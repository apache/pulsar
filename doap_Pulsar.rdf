    <shortdesc>Apache Pulsar is a distributed messaging and streaming platform built for the cloud.</shortdesc>
    <description>Apache Pulsar is an all-in-one messaging and streaming platform. Messages can be consumed and acknowledged individually or consumed as streams with less than 10ms of latency. Its layered architecture allows rapid scaling across hundreds of nodes, without data reshuffling.

Its features include multi-tenancy with resource separation and access control, geo-replication across regions, tiered storage and support for six official client languages. It supports up to one million unique topics and is designed to simplify your application architecture.</description>
