/**
 * The interface to acknowledge one or more messages individually or cumulatively.
 * <p>
 * It contains two methods of various overloads:
 * - `acknowledge`: acknowledge individually
 * - `acknowledgeCumulative`: acknowledge cumulatively
 * Each of them has an associated asynchronous API that has the "Async" suffix in the name.
 * <p>
 * The 1st method parameter is
 * - {@link MessageId} or {@link Message} when acknowledging a single message
 * - {@link java.util.List<MessageId>} or {@link Messages} when acknowledging multiple messages
 * <p>
 * The 2nd method parameter is optional. Specify a non-null {@link Transaction} instance for transaction usages:
 * - After the transaction is committed, the message will be actually acknowledged (individually or cumulatively).
 * - After the transaction is aborted, the message will be redelivered.
 * @see Transaction#commit()
 * @see Transaction#abort()
