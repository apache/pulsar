    Delete offloaded ledger when ledger deleted (#1641)
    
    * Delete offloaded ledger when ledger deleted
    
    When a managed ledger trims a ledger, if that ledger has been
    offloaded to long term storage, delete it from long term storage
    also.
    
    Currently, it will always try to delete the bookkeeper ledger also,
    even if the ledger has already been offloaded. Handling for this case
    will be added in a later patch along with delayed bookkeeper ledger
    deletion in the case of offload.
    
    Master Issue: #1511
    
    * Fixup for delete

     Rename Connect `Message` interface to `Record` (#1636)
    
    * Rename Connect `Message` interface to `Record`
    
    *Motivation*
    
    Having two different `Message` interfaces is a bit confusing and also introduced unnecessary object allocation.
    
    *Solution*
    
    - rename connect `Message` interface to `Record` interface
    - introduce an abstract base implementation for both `api.Message` and `connect.Record`
    - change the places to the new class
    
    * Add the missing class file
    
    * - change Map<String, String> to Map<String, Object> for all open calls
    - add a `RuntimeSink` in functions which extends Sink and provides the flexibility to control acking behavior for pulsar sink
    
    * record sequence should be part of RecordContext

    Encryption semi-support for Compaction (#1623)
    
    * Encryption semi-support for Compaction
    
    Without batching, compaction of encrypted topics works as it does with
    any other topic.
    
    However, with batching, compaction of encrypted topics is unable to
    break the batched messages into individual messages, so it's unable to
    read the keys which is uses for compaction, as compaction doesn't have
    access to the encryption key which was used to encrypt the payload.
    
    This change makes it possible to use compaction with an encrypted
    topic, though when it comes across a batched message, it just lets the
    whole batch pass through.
    
    * Fix integration test (bad merge from master)

    If there is no consumers connected, we don't need to notify the consumers. This will prevent NPE.
    
    *Result*
    
    Fix the NPE issue and add a test to cover this case.

    Add metadata to compacted topic ledger on creation (#1570)
    
    This can be used by ops to identify what the ledger is, and where it
    can be cleaned up. There are corner cases where a compacted topic
    ledger may be created, but never attached to the topic, just as there
    are with managed ledger ledgers, so we need some way that these can be
    identified for garbage collection later.

    Compaction commands for pulsar-admin (#1596)
    
    Adds an compact and compaction-status command in the persistent
    subcommand of pulsar-admin.
    
    This command differs from the compact-topic CLI (part of pulsar
    command), in that it triggers compaction to occur via the REST api,
    which causes the compaction to run in the broker process. The
    compact-topic CLI spawns a new process to run the compaction.
    
    Patch also fixes batch detection, which was broken (uncovered by a
    change in the defaults), and recycles some metadata that wasn't being
    recycled previously.

    Add properties alias for tenants in pulsar-admin (#1592)
    
    Recently properties was renamed to tenants in the pulsar-admin
    CLI. However, people may already have scripts that depend on the
    properties command existing, which will break with such a change.
    
    This patch adds an alias for tenants, which so that the commands will
    not break. However, it will not show up in the usage command, so
    people will be encouraged to use tenants.
    
    The change also makes pulsar-admin exit with a non-error code when
    --help is run. This is needed to test, and is standard on unix utils.

    If you want to run pulsar on a preexisting bookkeeper installation,
    there's currently no way to format the metadata.
    
    This patch skips the bookkeeper initialization if /ledgers already
    exists, which indicates that it has already been formatted.

    Allow proxy to come up before any brokers have (#1559)
    
    If no brokers have come up, then /loadbalance/brokers will not have
    been created. Previously, if a proxy came up at this point, it would
    get a NoNodeException when it tried to watch the children of this
    path, and the proxy itself would hang.
    
    This change modifies the ZooKeeper cache, so that if you try to
    getChildren on a node that doesn't exist, a watcher on that path's
    existance will be created before the NoNodeException is thrown.
    
    Callers can then call getChildren with a watcher, and expect the
    watcher to trigger when the the node is created and has another node
    created below it.

    Refactor JavaInstanceRunnable (#1533)
    
    *Motivation*
    
    EffectivelyOnce processing made `JavaInstanceRunnable` very complicated. There are tons of braching logic. It makes code hard to maintain.
    
    *Solution*
    
    Abstract the processing guarantee related logic into a `MessageProcessor` interface. Implement `at-most-once`, `at-least-once` and `effectively-once` processors.
    
    *Result*
    
    After this change, `JavaInstanceRunnable` is much cleaner. `At-Least-Once` and `At-Most-Once` logic are much simpler and easier to debug.

    Managed ledger uses ReadHandle in read path (#1513)
    
    * Managed ledger uses ReadHandle in read path
    
    BookKeeper 4.6 introduced a new API for reading, called
    ReadHandle. This API is an small interface, unlike LedgerHandle, so it
    is possible to provide implementations of ReadHandle that read from
    sources other than bookkeeper, while presenting the same interface as
    when reading from bookkeeper.
    
    This patch changes the managed ledger entry read path to use
    ReadHandle. This is rquired to implement tiered storage (PIP-17).
    
    Master issue: 1511
    
    * Use whenCompleteAsync and chooseThread where possible
    
    To avoid creating yet another runnable.
    
    * Fix failing BrokerBkEnsembleTest
    
    And another merge conflict.

    Compaction considers messages with empty payload as deleting the key (#1525)
    
    If the latest message with a key has an empty payload, compaction
    will take this to mean that the key has been deleted, so it will not
    be stored in the compacted topic ledger.
    
    This patch also introduces empty messages, which were not previously
    possible.

    Compaction allows keyless messages to pass through (#1514)
    
    If a message has no key it's impossible to know if a later message
    supercedes it, so in this case, it should be simply passed through
    compaction (i.e. it should appear when reading from a compacted
    topic).

    The java client page gives instructions for pulling in the pulsar
    client, but not for pulling in the admin client. Given this, a user
    will assume that the admin client is part of the same module.
    
    This change adds the maven artifact to the table so that it is clear
    that it is separate.

    Utility to rebatch a message (#1391)
    
    * Utility to rebatch a message
    
    When compacting a batched message, we need to take the message, break
    it into its constituent submessages, select the submessages we wish to
    keep, and rebuild the batched message. In other words rebatching. To
    maintain the same batched message ids, the submessages which are not
    selected are replaced with dummy messages with the compactedOut flag
    set to true.
    
    This patch contains a utility method to do this rebatching, along with
    another utility to extract the ids and keys from a batch. These will
    be used to add batching support to compaction in a later patch.
    
    * Avoid double release of m1

    Build batching-awareness into round-robin message router (#1387)
    
    * Build batching-awareness into round-robin message router
    
    *Motivation*
    
    The default `SinglePartition` message router works well when you have more producers than the number of partitions.
    Howerver partitions will become idle if you have more partitions than producers. In the case of `producers` <= `partitions`,
    a round-robin message router works better. However the current round-robin messages router doesn't take `batching` into account.
    
    *Modification*
    
    Improve the current round-robin message router to build batching awareness into it. The round-robin messages router choose
    partition based on a randomly-chosen start partition id and the current milliseconds (round-up at the `maxBatchingDelayMs` boundary).
    This guarantees that at a given `maxBatchingDelayMs`, the message router is always choosing a same partition, this improves batching locality.

    Improve sync send logic for allowing batching (#1386)
    
    *Motivation*
    
    Batching is required for achieving high performance messaging. If we want to flip the default behaviour of publishers into batch publishing,
    we need to improve current send logic to flush out batches after enqueuing the send requests. so batch settings won't impact sync sends.
    
    *Modification*
    
    - add a flush() method on single partition producer
    - break the send logic on single partition producer to `enqueue-flush-wait`
    - change multi-partitions producer to use single partition producer

    * Add compactedOut flag for batched messages
    
    If batched messages are to be compactable without changing their
    message ids, we need to be able to pad out the batch with empty
    messages, so that the batch index does not change.
    
    For this purpose, this patch introduces a flag, compactedOut. If a
    message in the batch has this flag, it will not be passed to the
    consumer.

    Allow override of redirectTestOutput from CLI (#1366)
    
    If a maven option is set in the configuration, it's impossible to
    override from the commandline. Sometimes, you want to be able to see
    the output of a test on the commandline, such as in the case where the
    test is hanging. This patch adds a property, so that the default
    configuration of redirecting test output to a file can be overridden.

    Fix race in PersistentTopicTest#testClosingReplicationProducerTwice (#1360)
    
    A race existed where the replicator was making a startProducer call on
    construction before the client was mocked. This startProducer would
    fail on producer creation, which would trigger a backoff and a
    retry. If this fell exactly the wrong way, it could cause
    createProducerAsync to be called multiple times on the mock before the
    check, which would fail the test.
    
    This fix addresses issue #617 and it's duplicate #1145

    CompactedTopic should seek to position of cursor, not next position (#1336)
    
    * CompactedTopic should seek to position of cursor, not next position
    
    When finding the first ledger entry to read from while reading from a
    compacted topic ledger, we should find the position represented by the
    cursor read position, not the next position after as has been done
    until now.
    
    This bug was due to a misunderstanding of how the read position
    works. It was assumed it worked the same as the mark-delete position,
    which is not the case.

    Base module for Arquillian integration tests (#1349)
    
    Pulls in dependencies needed by all Arquillian integration tests, and
    configures surefire with enough memory. It also configures surefire
    tests to only run when the "integrationTests" system property is
    defined.
    
    All arquillian integration tests should set this module as their
    parent.

    Arquillian topologies for integration testing (#1333)
    
    Module to distribute arquillian topologies for integration
    testing. I've put them in a module so multiple tests can share the
    same topology.
    
    There is currently only one topology. This runs a single pulsar
    cluster with:
    - 1 local zookeeper container
    - 1 global zookeeper container
    - 3 bookkeeper bookie containers
    - 2 pulsar brokers (unstarted)
    - 1 pulsar proxy (unstarted)

    Improve function package download process (#268)
    
    - downloader is writing the package to a temp location
    - after a package is downloaded, a hardlink is created to link to the temp file. hardlink will ensure one createLink succeed.
    - after the hardlink is created, the temp files can be deleted.
    
    After this change, it allows concurrent downloading without interleaving with each other.

    Fix NPE on serializing MembershipManager (#235)
    
    
    
    *Problem*
    
    If we assign workerConfig after setting consumer listener, when `ConsumerStats` tries to dump the consumer configuration,
    it will throw NPE.
    
    *Solution*
    
    https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/pull/1260 tried to ignore listener fields for json serialization
    
    this change focus on avoiding NPE on serializing MembershipManager

    Refactor to support at-least-once processing (#54)
    
    * Refactor to support at-least-once processing
    
    This change is refactoring the relationship between Spawner, FunctionContainer and JavaInstance to better support various processing semantics.
    
    - ThreadFunctionContainerFactory is a "singleton" across multiple functions.
    - Spawner, FunctionContainer and JavaInstance are per function. Spawner is manging the lifecycle of function container, in the function container
      it will folks a thread for running java instance, because it has to load classpathes correctly.
    - Remove subscribermanager and move consumer and producer logic into container. that means in future if we are supporting process based and docker
      based container, we can just take the thread container and run it directly as a separate process or a separate docker process. There is no
      extra communication between spawner and containers.
    
    * Create pulsar client in thread container factory

    Input and Output Serdes (#31)
    
    ### Motivation
    
    input type can be different output type. so we need two serdes for each function.
    
    ### Modifications
    
    - add inputSerde and outputSerde
    - verify both input and output serde to make sure their types are consistent with function types
    
    ### Result
    
    user run functions with input/output serdes.

    Make SerDe interface a generic interface and load the serde class in JavaInstance (#30)
    
    ### Motivation
    
    SerDe is user defined class which used for serializing and deserializing objects for functions. So the initialization of a SerDe class should happen along with Function class and done by the context class loader.
    
    Also SerDe should be a generic-typed interface and the type should be consistent with function type.
    
    ### Modifications
    
    - make SerDe a generic-typed interface
    - move SerDe initialization to JavaInstance and use the thread context class loader
    - verify SerDe type
    - move reflection related code to a util class `Reflections`
    
    ### Result
    
    - SerDe is a generic-typed interface
    - JavaInstance initializes both function and serdes and verifies the types.

    Introduce `functioncache` and `functioncontainer` (#9)
    
    * Introduce `functioncache` and `functioncontainer`
    
    - introduce `functioncache` for managing function dependencies (e.g. setting up function class loader and its classpath). The `functioncache` is shared across multiple instances.
    - introduce `functioncontainer` for providing a runtime environment to invoke functions.
    - provide a thread based `functioncontainer` implementation, which uses functioncache to load classpath and initial its function class loader.
    
    * Revert FunctionID/InstanceID to String
    
    * Add test cases for functioncache and functioncontainer

    Introduce a pulsar log4j2 appender (#1316)
    
    ### Motivation
    
    when developing `pulsar-functions`, it would be good to log the log messages generated by functions to pulsar, so the user can easily tail the log messages topic to get all the messages per functions.
    
    ### Modifications
    
    This PR is to add a pulsar based appender.
    
    ### Result
    
    We are able to use pulsar log4j2 appender to log messages.

    Cleanup old compacted topic ledgers when a new one is available (#1302)
    
    When a broker is notified of a new compacted ledger for a topic, and
    after it has been persisted to the compaction cursor, delete the old
    compacted topic ledger. The deletion is best effort. If it fails it
    doesn't affect reading from the newer ledger.
    
    This isn't foolproof by any means. There's still plenty of
    opportunities for ledgers to be orphaned. We'll need some sort of GC
    based on ledger metadata to handle all cases, but that needs a newer
    bookkeeper (for the metadata properties changes).

    Docker compose doesn't have any way to run initialization like k8s

    wait for a znode to be created in zookeeper, check if it exists and
    create it. It can be used to ensure that pulsar brokers and bookies do
    not come up before metadata format has run.

    Compaction uses GetLastMessageId (#1286)
    
    In two phase compaction, we read from the start of the topic to the
    end. Previously, we had no reliable way to knowing if we were at the
    end of the topic, so we used timeouts.
    
    However, with the new GetLastMessageId api, we can find how far we
    should read in a topic, and just stop when we get there.

    A batch message id is a MessageIdImpl with a batchIndex >=
    0. Therefore, they can be compared to MessageIdImpl. If all fields
    other than the batchIndex are equal to a messageId, the
    BatchMessageIdImpl can compare its batchIndex with -1. If it is -1, it
    matches the MessageIdImpl. If it is greater than -1, then it is
    greater than the MessageIdImpl.

    Add JsonIgnore to a few fields in configuration objects (#1260)
    
    *Problem*
    
    We have seen NPE thrown when `ConsumerStats` tries to dump the configuration object with a customized ConsumerEventsListener.
    The problem came from initialization sequence and when jackson tried to serialize the customized ConsumerEventsListener,
    it fails with NPE.
    
    In general, those customized implementation such as `MessageRouter`, `MessageListener` and `ConsumerEventsListener` are not
    really needed to serialize as part of json.
    
    *Solution*
    
    Add @JsonIgnore to those fields to bypass json serialization

    ProxyForwardAuthDataTest shouldn't reuse pulsar client (#1230)
    
    * ProxyForwardAuthDataTest shouldn't reuse pulsar client
    
    This test was flaking due to the pulsar client being reused. The test
    starts a proxy service, subscribes to a topic, stops the proxy, starts
    a new proxy and tries to subscribe again.
    
    If using the same client for both connections, the client will have an
    open connection to the first proxy, which, when the proxy is stopped,
    will be closed by netty asynchronously. This can race with the second
    subscription attempt, and cause it to fail with
    ConnectionClosedException. Specifically, if the subscription attempt
    runs before the netty callback runs, the subscription attempt will try
    to subscribe on a dead connection.
    
    The immediate fix for this test, to stop the flaking, is just to use a
    different client for each attempt.

    Algorithm to find start point of compacted ledger (#1205)
    
    * Algorithm to find start point of compacted ledger
    
    When reading from a compacted topic ledger, the reader will have to find
    the the first entry whole message id is greater than or equal to the
    position of the cursor. This involves a binary search into the ledger.
    
    This patch implements this binary search, along with basic caching to
    avoid rereading the same entry multiple times.

    Notify topic of ledger when compaction finishes (#1188)
    
    When the compactor finishes compacting a topic, it send a cumulative
    acknowledgement to the broker, containing the ledger ID that the topic
    was compacted into. Hitherto the broker has done nothing with this
    acknowledgement.
    
    This patch introduces the compacted topic interface, and, for now, a
    dummy implementation of this interface. It also introduces a
    specialization of PersistentSubscription which is created for the
    compactor's subscription. When this subscription receives a cumulative
    acknowledgement, it extracts the ledger id for the acknowledgement
    topics, and notifies the compacted topic interface of this newly
    available compacted ledger. For now, the compacted topic implementation
    does nothing with it. This will be in a later patch.

    Read compacted consumer flag (#1136)
    
    * Read compacted consumer flag
    
    When enabled, a consumer will read messages from a compacted topic
    ledger if available. When disabled, the consumer will read from the
    message backlog as before, even if the topic has been compacted.
    
    The logic for actually reading from the compacted topic will be
    submitted in following patch.
    
    * readcompacted only works on non-shared subs on persistent topics
    
    Document this in the javadoc and add server side validation
    
    * Add client side validation
    
    Of course these occlude the server side validations, so they can't be
    tested without doing something nasty.

    Debump netty version by 1 due to ObjectCleaner bug (#1163)
    
    The ObjectCleaner can possibly keep a process alive forever with netty
    4.1.20 since it is not a daemon thread.
    
    See: https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7617
    
    This causes initialize-cluster-metadata to hang forever. 4.1.19
    doesn't have this issue, so we should drop down to that until the fix
    is in a release.

    Explicitly set zookeeper version in broker (#1132)
    
    * Explicitly set zookeeper version in broker
    
    The broker "shades" zookeeper via the aspectj stuff, but the version
    it shades is the one pulled in with bookkeeper-server, not the version
    specified in the top level pom. This is fairly harmless, but it breaks
    the pulsar zookeeper-shell command if you want to specify a zookeeper
    command from the commandline.
    
    This change explicitly pulls in the correct zookeeper version,
    excluding all the stuff that we usually exclude when pulling zookeeper.
    
    * Move to dependencyManagement
    
    Doing so stops us pulling in junit, so a test needed a fixup
    
    * changed compiler version by mistake
    
    * It actually needs netty. It pulls 3, we pull 4, they use different packages

    * Update maven compiler plugin to newest version
    
    The previously used version doesn't handle the errors from newer jdk
    versions, so if there's a error you can't see what's actually wrong.
    
    * Let aspectJ bind to correct phase
    
    It was binding to process-sources before, which makes no sense since
    it works on the class files. Removed the phase specification, which
    allows it to bind to compile (as it does by default).

    Compact algo (#1044)
    
    * Compaction algorithm for Pulsar
    
    Compaction will go through the topic in two passes. The first pass
    selects latest offset for each key in the topic. Then the second pass
    writes these values to a ledger.
    
    The two passes are required to avoid holding the payloads of each of
    the latest values in memory, as the payload can be many orders of
    magnitude larger than a message id.
    
    * fix nits
    
    * fixup for compactor, empty test
    
    * Shade plugin doesn't like CompletableFuture<?>, which is weird
    
    * Address @rdhabalia comments

    RawReader#readNextAsync returns a Future<RawMessage> to the user, which includes a
    retained ByteBuf. If the user is no longer interested in the result of
    the read call, it should be able to cancel to ensure that the ByteBuf
    is released.

    cancelled, all read requests that were made after the cancelled
    request will also be cancelled.

    Add utility to explode raw batch into individual messages (#993)
    
    The utility method takes a raw batch message and generates then
    generates a raw message for each message in the batch. The generated
    messages have metadata which is a composite of the batch message
    metadata, and the single message metadata for that message. The
    message ID is generated by using the offset within the batch message
    along with the message ID of the batch message itself.
    
    Returning a ByteBuf for the metadataAndPayload of the batched message
    involves a copy of the payload, as both DoubleByteBuf doesn't work
    with getShort() and CompositeByteBuf does not work with slice(). I
    think this is ok for now though, as this will only be used by
    compaction, and compaction is a batch process, so latency isn't
    paramount. However, this should be revisited if this does prove to be
    causing performance problems.

    Acknowledgement with properties for RawReader (#1006)
    
    * Acknowledgement with properties for RawReader
    
    This will be used by the compactor to update the topic with the
    compacted ledger. There will be a cursor/subscription owned by the
    compactor which keeps track of where we have compacted until, and the
    ID of the ledger into which the compacted data has been written.
    
    This change exposes the cursor's String->Long properties map which is
    already available for Producer sequence tracking. This is only exposed
    through the RawReader, which is part of the broker module. Clients
    will not be able to use it.

    Raw Reader for Pulsar Topics (#962)
    
    * Raw Reader for Pulsar Topics
    
    This reader reads message from the pulsar topic in the same format
    that they are stored in persistent storage.
    
    This is a requirement for topic compaction, as the compactor will need
    to be able to read from a topic and store the read messaging somewhere
    else in a format that can then be easily read back by the broker. If
    the compactor were to decrypt, decompress and decode the messages, it
    would complicate things on the client side, as it would then need to
    have access to decryption keys, etc.
    
    The initial implementation does not account for partitions or
    batching. This will be added later.

    Fix shared reference between the two load reports (#450)
    
    This shared reference caused the resource usages between the current report (not published to ZooKeeper) and the

    a broker restart), the load report only got written once per 15 minutes.
