 * invoke whenever they have data to be published to Pulsar.
 * The lifecycle of a PushSource is to open it passing any config needed
 * by it to initialize(like open network connection, authenticate, etc).
 * A consumer is then to it which is invoked by the source whenever
 * there is data to be published. Once all data has been read, one can use close
 * at the end of the session to do any cleanup
