/**
 * Interface for writing Batch sources
 *
 * The lifecycle of the BatchSource is as follows
 * 1. open - called once when connector is started.  Can use method to perform
 *    certain one-time operations such as init/setup operations. This is called on all
 *    instances of the source and is analogous to the open method of the streaming Source api.
 * 2. discover (called only on one instance (Currently instance zero(0), but might change later))
 *    - The discovery phase will be executed on one instance of the connector.
 *    - discover is triggered by the BatchSourceTriggerer class configured for this source.
 *    - As and when discover discovers new tasks, it will emit them using the taskEater method.
 *    - The framework will distribute the discovered tasks among all instances
 * 3. prepare - is called on an instance when there is a new discovered task assigned for that instance
 *    - The framework decides which discovered task is routed to which source instance. The connector
 *      does not currently have a way to influence this.
 *    - prepare is only called when the instance has fetched all records using readNext for its previously
 *      assigned discovered task.
 * 4. readNext is called repeatedly by the framework to fetch the next record. If there are no
 *             more records available to emit, the connector should return null. That indicates
 *             that all records for that particular discovered task is complete.
 * 5. close is called when the source is stopped/deleted. This is analogous to the streaming Source api.
