apache-pulsar (4.1.2-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed debian/rules: only main apache-pulsar.service is installed automatically
    via dh_installsystemd. Additional services (bookie, proxy, functions-worker,
    websocket, autorecovery) are installed as examples in
    /usr/share/apache-pulsar/examples/systemd/ for manual activation
  * Updated debian/control: changed Java dependency to support both Java 21 and 17
    (openjdk-21-jre-headless | openjdk-17-jre-headless) for compatibility with
    Debian Trixie and older versions
  * Fixed debian/rules: added override_dh_installdeb and override_dh_builddeb
    to ensure postinst script is properly packaged. The script creates system
    user apache-pulsar, sets directory permissions, and creates log directory
  * Updated debian/install: added installation of additional systemd service files
    as examples in /usr/share/apache-pulsar/examples/systemd/
  * Updated debian/README: documented current package structure, maintainer scripts
    handling, and systemd services installation approach
