apache-pulsar: jar-not-in-usr-share
# Pulsar broker jar is installed in /usr/lib/apache-pulsar as it's part of the
# application structure, not a shared library

apache-pulsar: maintainer-shell-script-fails-syntax-check
# Scripts are checked in isolated context where environment variables are not available
# These scripts are syntactically correct and work properly at runtime

apache-pulsar: shell-script-fails-syntax-check
# Application scripts use environment variables and check for command availability
# which cannot be validated in lintian's isolated context. Scripts are correct.

apache-pulsar: maintainer-script-calls-systemctl
# systemctl calls are automatically added by dh_installsystemd and are necessary
# for proper systemd service management

apache-pulsar: missing-dep-on-jarwrapper
# Pulsar uses bash scripts to launch Java applications, not jarwrapper
# The main entry point is /usr/lib/apache-pulsar/bin/pulsar script

apache-pulsar: executable-jar-without-main-class
# Some jar files may have execute bits set incorrectly, but they are not
# meant to be executed directly. All execution goes through bash scripts.

apache-pulsar: codeless-jar
# Some jar files are empty or contain only metadata (e.g., dummyexamples.jar,
# listenablefuture-empty jar). This is normal for dependency management.

apache-pulsar: jar-contains-source
# Some third-party libraries (e.g., jsr305) include source files in their
# jar archives. This is a common practice and acceptable.
