# Arbitrary Configuration
###########################
# When a configuration parameter is not explicitly named in the WorkerConfig class, it is only accessible from the
# properties map. This map can be configured by supplying values to the properties map in this config file.

# Configure the DLog bookkeeper client by prefixing configurations with "bookkeeper_". Because these are arbitrary, they
# must be added to the properties map to get correctly applied. This configuration applies to the Dlog bookkeeper client
# in both the standalone function workers and function workers initialized in the broker.

# You can add extra configuration options for the Pulsar Client and the Pulsar Admin Client
# by prefixing them with "brokerClient_". These configurations are applied after hard coded configuration
# and before the above brokerClient configurations named above.

## For example, when using the token authentication provider (AuthenticationProviderToken), you must configure several
## custom configurations. Here is a sample for configuring one of the necessary configs:
#properties:
#    tokenPublicKey: "file:///path/to/my/key"
#    tokenPublicAlg: "RSA256"
