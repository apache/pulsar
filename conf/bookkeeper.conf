# interface(i.e. the interface it uses to establish its identity)?
# By default, loopback interfaces are not allowed as the primary

# Using a loopback interface as the primary interface usually indicates
# a configuration error. For example, its fairly common in some VPS setups
# to not configure a hostname, or to have the hostname resolve to
# 127.0.0.1. If this is the case, then all bookies in the cluster will
# establish their identities as 127.0.0.1:3181, and only one will be able
# to join the cluster. For VPSs configured like this, you should explicitly
# set the listening interface.

## Placement settings
#############################################################################

# the following settings take effects when `autoRecoveryDaemonEnabled` is true.

# The ensemble placement policy used for re-replicating entries.
# 
# Options:
#   - org.apache.bookkeeper.client.RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy
#   - org.apache.bookkeeper.client.RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy
#
# Default value:
#   org.apache.bookkeeper.client.RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy
#
# ensemblePlacementPolicy=org.apache.bookkeeper.client.RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy

# The dns resolver class used for resolving network locations for bookies. This setting is used
# when using either RackawareEnsemblePlacementPolicy and RegionAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy
# reppDnsResolverClass=org.apache.bookkeeper.net.ScriptBasedMapping

# The bash script used by `ScriptBasedMapping` dns resolver for resolving bookies' network locations.
# networkTopologyScriptFileName=

# The max number of args used in the script provided at `networkTopologyScriptFileName`

#############################################################################
## Auditor settings
#############################################################################

# The interval between auditor bookie checks.
# The auditor bookie check, checks ledger metadata to see which bookies should
# contain entries for each ledger. If a bookie which should contain entries is
# unavailable, then the ledger containing that entry is marked for recovery.
# Setting this to 0 disabled the periodic check. Bookie checks will still
# run when a bookie fails.
# The interval is specified in seconds.
auditorPeriodicBookieCheckInterval=86400

# Interval at which the auditor will do a check of all ledgers in the cluster.
# By default this runs once a week. The interval is set in seconds.
# To disable the periodic check completely, set this to 0.
# Note that periodic checking will put extra load on the cluster, so it should
# not be run more frequently than once a day.
auditorPeriodicCheckInterval=604800

# The percentage of a ledger (fragment)'s entries will be verified before claiming this fragment as missing fragment.
# Default is 0, which only verify the first and last entries of a given fragment.
auditorLedgerVerificationPercentage=0

# How long to wait, in seconds, before starting auto recovery of a lost bookie
lostBookieRecoveryDelay=0

#############################################################################
## Replication Worker settings
#############################################################################

# The number of entries that a replication will rereplicate in parallel.
rereplicationEntryBatchSize=5000

# The grace period, in seconds, that the replication worker waits before fencing and
# replicating a ledger fragment that's still being written to upon bookie failure.
openLedgerRereplicationGracePeriod=30

# The time to backoff when replication worker encounters exceptions on replicating a ledger, in milliseconds.
rwRereplicateBackoffMs=5000
