# Whether the bookie allowed to use a loopback interface as its primary
# interface(i.e. the interface it uses to establish its identity)?
# By default, loopback interfaces are not allowed as the primary
# interface.
# Using a loopback interface as the primary interface usually indicates
# a configuration error. For example, its fairly common in some VPS setups
# to not configure a hostname, or to have the hostname resolve to
# 127.0.0.1. If this is the case, then all bookies in the cluster will
# establish their identities as 127.0.0.1:3181, and only one will be able
# to join the cluster. For VPSs configured like this, you should explicitly
# set the listening interface.

# Size of a index page in ledger cache, in bytes
# A larger index page can improve performance writing page to disk,

# ledgers have similar number of entries.
# If you have large number of ledgers and each ledger has fewer entries,
# smaller index page would improve memory usage.
# pageSize=8192

# How many index pages provided in ledger cache
# If number of index pages reaches this limitation, bookie server
# starts to swap some ledgers from memory to disk. You can increment
# this value when you found swap became more frequent. But make sure
# pageLimit*pageSize should not more than JVM max memory limitation,
# otherwise you would got OutOfMemoryException.
# In general, incrementing pageLimit, using smaller index page would
# gain bettern performance in lager number of ledgers with fewer entries case

# the limitation of number of index pages.
