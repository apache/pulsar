admin_rest_api:
  type: info
  title: The REST API is *the* admin interface
  content: |
    Under the hood, both the `pulsar-admin` CLI tool and the Java client both use the REST API. If you'd like to implement your own admin interface client, you should use the REST API as well. Full documentation can be found [here](../../reference/RestApi).
tls_role_tokens:
  type: warning
  title: TLS encryption strongly recommended
  content: |
    Please note that using TLS encryption is strongly recommended when using Athenz as an authentication provider, as it can protect role tokens from being intercepted and reused (see also [this doc](https://github.com/yahoo/athenz/blob/master/docs/data_model.md)).
broker_conf_doc:
  type: info

properties_multiple_clusters:
  type: success
  content: |
    When working with properties, you can specify which of your Pulsar clusters your property is allowed to use. This enables you to also have cluster-level authorization schemes.
subscriptions_local:
  type: warning
  title: Subscriptions are local to a cluster
  content: |
     While producers and consumers can publish to and consume from any cluster in a Pulsar instance, subscriptions are local to the clusters in which they are created and cannot be transferred between clusters. If you do need to transfer a subscription, you'll need to create a new subscription in the desired cluster.
shared_mode_limitations:
  type: warning
  title: Limitations of shared mode
  content: |
    There are two important things to be aware of when using shared mode:

    1. Message ordering is not guaranteed.
    2. You cannot use [cumulative acknowledgment](#acknowledgement) with shared mode.
global_cluster: |
  If you're running a multi-cluster Pulsar instance, you can manage instance-level

  type: warning
