## Requirements

 * A C++ compiler that supports C++11, like GCC >= 4.8
 * CMake >= 3.4
 * [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
 * [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) >= 3
 * [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/)
 * [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)

It's recommended to use Protocol Buffer 2.6 because it's verified by CI, but 3.x also works.

The default supported [compression types](include/pulsar/CompressionType.h) are:

- `CompressionNone`
- `CompressionLZ4`

If you want to enable other compression types, you need to install:

- `CompressionZLib`: [zlib](https://zlib.net/)
- `CompressionZSTD`: [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd)
- `CompressionSNAPPY`: [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy)

If you want to build and run the tests, you need to install [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest). Otherwise, you need to add CMake option `-DBUILD_TESTS=OFF`.

If you don't want to build Python client since `boost-python` may not be easy to install, you need to add CMake option `-DBUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPER=OFF`.

If you want to use `ClientConfiguration::setLogConfFilePath`, you need to install the [Log4CXX](https://logging.apache.org/log4cxx) and add CMake option `-DUSE_LOG4CXX=ON`.

## Platforms

Pulsar C++ Client Library has been tested on:

* Linux
* Mac OS X
* Windows x64

## Compilation

### Compile within a Docker container

You can compile the C++ client library within a Docker container that already
contains all the required dependencies.

```shell
./docker-build.sh
```

Run unit tests:
```shell
./docker-tests.sh
```

### Compile on Ubuntu Server 16.04

#### Install all dependencies:

```shell
apt-get install -y g++ cmake libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev liblog4cxx-dev \
                libprotobuf-dev libboost-all-dev  libgtest-dev google-mock \
                protobuf-compiler python-setuptools
```

#### Compile and install Google Test:

```shell
cd /usr/src/gtest
sudo cmake .
sudo make
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib
```


#### Compile and install Google Mock:

```shell
cd /usr/src/gmock
sudo cmake .
sudo make
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib
```


#### Compile Pulsar client library:

```shell
cd pulsar/pulsar-client-cpp
cmake .
make
```

#### Checks
##### Client library will be placed in
```
lib/libpulsar.so
lib/libpulsar.a
```

##### Tools will be placed in

```
perf/perfProducer
perf/perfConsumer
```

### Compile on Mac OS X

#### Install all dependencies:
```shell
# For openSSL
brew install openssl
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl/

# For Protobuf
brew install protobuf boost boost-python log4cxx jsoncpp
// If you are using python3, you need to install boost-python3

# For gtest
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
cd googletest
cmake .
make install
# Refer gtest documentation in case you get stuck somewhere
```

#### Compile Pulsar client library:
```shell
export PULSAR_PATH=<Path where you cloned pulsar repo>
cd ${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/
cmake .
make
```

#### Checks
##### Client library will be placed in
```
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/lib/libpulsar.dylib
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/lib/libpulsar.a
```

##### Tools will be placed in:

```
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/perf/perfProducer
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/perf/perfConsumer
```

### Compile on Windows

#### Install with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)

It's highly recommended to use `vcpkg` for C++ package management on Windows. It's easy to install and well supported by Visual Studio (2015/2017/2019) and CMake. See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows) for quick start.

Take Windows 64-bit library as an example, you only need to run

```bash
vcpkg install --feature-flags=manifests --triplet x64-windows
```

> NOTE: For Windows 32-bit library, change `x64-windows` to `x86-windows`, see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/users/triplets.md) for more details about the triplet concept in Vcpkg.

The all dependencies, which are specified by [vcpkg.json](vcpkg.json), will be installed in `vcpkg_installed/` subdirectory,

With `vcpkg`, you only need to run two commands:

```bash
cmake \
 -B ./build \
 -A x64 \
 -DBUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPER=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF \
 -DVCPKG_TRIPLET=x64-windows \
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
 -S .
cmake --build ./build --config Release
```

Then all artifacts will be built into `build` subdirectory.

> **NOTE**
>
> 1. For Windows 32-bit, you need to use `-A Win32` and `-DVCPKG_TRIPLET=x86-windows`.
> 2. For MSVC Debug mode, you need to replace `Release` with `Debug` for both `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable and `--config` option.

#### Install dependencies manually

You need to install [dlfcn-win32](https://github.com/dlfcn-win32/dlfcn-win32) in addition.

If you installed the dependencies manually, you need to run

```shell
#If all dependencies are in your path, all that is necessary is
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/cmake .

#if all dependencies are not in your path, then passing in a PROTOC_PATH and CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is necessary
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/cmake -DPROTOC_PATH=C:/protobuf/bin/protoc -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/boost;C:/openssl;C:/zlib;C:/curl;C:/protobuf;C:/googletest;C:/dlfcn-win32" .

#This will generate pulsar-cpp.sln. Open this in Visual Studio and build the desired configurations.
```

#### Checks

##### Client libraries are available in the following places.
```
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/build/lib/Release/pulsar.lib
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/build/lib/Release/pulsar.dll
```

#### Examples

##### Add windows environment paths.
```
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/build/lib/Release
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/vcpkg_installed
```

##### Examples are available in.
```
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/build/examples/Release
```

## Tests
```shell
# Source code
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/tests/

# Execution
# Start standalone broker
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-test-service-start.sh

# Run the tests
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-client-cpp/tests/main

# When no longer needed, stop standalone broker
${PULSAR_PATH}/pulsar-test-service-stop.sh
```

## Requirements for Contributors

It's recommended to install [LLVM](https://llvm.org/builds/) for `clang-tidy` and `clang-format`. Pulsar C++ client use `clang-format` 5.0 to format files, which is a little different with latest `clang-format`.

We welcome contributions from the open source community, kindly make sure your changes are backward compatible with GCC 4.8 and Boost 1.53.
