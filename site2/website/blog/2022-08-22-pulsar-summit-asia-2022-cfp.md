Pulsar Summit is the conference dedicated to Apache Pulsar, and the messaging and event streaming community. The conference gathers an international audience of developers, data architects, data scientists, Apache Pulsar committers and contributors, as well as the messaging and streaming community. Together, they share experiences, exchange ideas and knowledge, and receive hands-on training sessions led by Pulsar experts.

In January this year, Pulsar Summit Asia 2021 (delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic) featured more than 25 interactive sessions by technologists, developers, software engineers, and software architects from StreamNative, BIGO, China Mobile, Nutanix, Tencent, and more. The conference drew over 1000 attendees around the world, including attendees from top technology, internet, and media companies, such as Tencent, TikTok, Alibaba, and Microsoft.

Pulsar Summit Asia 2022 will be hosted virtually on November 19th and 20th, 2022. It is expected to cover the pivotal topics and technologies at the core of Apache Pulsar.
