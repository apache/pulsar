Weâ€™re proud to announce the Pulsar Summit Asia 2021!

2021 has been a remarkable year for the Apache Pulsar community. [Both the technology and community are growing rapidly this year](https://streamnative.io/en/blog/community/2021-06-14-pulsar-hits-its-400th-contributor-and-passes-kafka-in-monthly-active-contributors), and [Pulsar Virtual Summit North America 2021](https://www.na2021.pulsar-summit.org) was a big success with 33 break-out sessions and more than 550 registrations.

Last year, [Pulsar Summit Asia](https://pulsar-summit.org/en/event/asia-2020) featured more than 40 interactive sessions by tech leads, open-source developers, software engineers, and software architects from Tencent Group, BIGO, Kingsoft Cloud, Splunk, Yahoo! JAPAN, Nutanix, Dada Group, TIBCO, Huawei Cloud, and more. The conference garnered nearly 1,000 attendees around the globe mostly from Asia, including attendees from top tech, fintech and media companies.

Cumulatively, the Pulsar Summits drew more than 100 speakers, thousands of attendees, and hundreds of companies from diverse industries. It is a unique opportunity to network and learn about Pulsar project updates, ecosystem developments, best practices, and adoption stories.

**This year, the Pulsar Summit Asia will be hosted on November 20-21, 2021 by StreamNative. You can join us offline in Beijing for one day of Pulsar Training and one day of keynotes and breakout sessions. All the talks will be streamed live online.**
