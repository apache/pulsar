Pulsar exposes the following metrics in Prometheus format. You can monitor your clusters with those metrics.

* [ZooKeeper](#zookeeper)
* [BookKeeper](#bookkeeper)
* [Broker](#broker)
* [Pulsar Functions](#pulsar-functions)
* [Proxy](#proxy)
* [Pulsar SQL Worker](#pulsar-sql-worker)

The following types of metrics are available:

- [Counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter): a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter. The value increases by default. You can reset the value to zero or restart your cluster.
- [Gauge](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge): a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.
- [Histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram): a histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets.
- [Summary](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#summary): similar to a histogram, a summary samples observations (usually things like request durations and response sizes). While it also provides a total count of observations and a sum of all observed values, it calculates configurable quantiles over a sliding time window.
