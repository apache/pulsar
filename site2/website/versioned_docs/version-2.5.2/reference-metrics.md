Pulsar exposes metrics in Prometheus format that can be collected and used for monitoring the health of the cluster.

* [ZooKeeper](#zookeeper)
* [BookKeeper](#bookkeeper)
* [Broker](#broker)

## Overview

The metrics exposed by Pulsar are in Prometheus format. The types of metrics are:

- [Counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter): a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter whose value can only increase or be reset to zero on restart.
- [Gauge](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge): a *gauge* is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.
- [Histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram): a histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. The `_bucket` suffix is the number of observations within a histogram bucket, configured with parameter `{le="<upper inclusive bound>"}`. The `_count` suffix is the number of observations, shown as a time series and behaves like a counter. The `_sum` suffix is the sum of observed values, also shown as a time series and behaves like a counter. These suffixes are together denoted by `_*` in this doc.
- [Summary](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#summary): similar to a histogram, a summary samples observations (usually things like request durations and response sizes). While it also provides a total count of observations and a sum of all observed values, it calculates configurable quantiles over a sliding time window.

## Monitor

You can [set up a Prometheus instance](https://prometheus.io/) to collect all the metrics exposed at Pulsar components and set up
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards to display the metrics and monitor your Pulsar cluster.

The following are some Grafana dashboards examples:

- [pulsar-grafana](http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/deploy-monitoring/#grafana): A grafana dashboard that displays metrics collected in Prometheus for Pulsar clusters running on Kubernetes.
- [apache-pulsar-grafana-dashboard](https://github.com/streamnative/apache-pulsar-grafana-dashboard): A collection of grafana dashboard templates for different Pulsar components running on both Kubernetes and on-premise machines.
