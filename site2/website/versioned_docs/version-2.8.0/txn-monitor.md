You can monitor the status of the transactions in Prometheus and Grafana using the [transaction metrics](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/next/reference-metrics/#pulsar-transaction). 

For how to configure Prometheus and Grafana, see [here](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/next/deploy-monitoring).
