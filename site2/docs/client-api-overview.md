Pulsar client APIs allow you to create and configure producers, consumers, and readers; produce and consume messages; perform authentication and authorization tasks, and so on via programmable interfaces. They encapsulate and optimize Pulsarâ€™s client-broker communication protocols and add additional features using Pulsar primitives. Pulsar exposes client APIs with language bindings for [Java](client-libraries-java.md), [C++](client-libraries-cpp.md), [Python](client-libraries-python.md), [Go](client-libraries-go.md), [Node.js](client-libraries-node.md), [WebSocket](client-libraries-websocket.md), and [C#](client-libraries-dotnet.md).
