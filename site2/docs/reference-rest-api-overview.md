A REST API (also known as RESTful API, REpresentational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software, using HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data following the REST standards. In essence, REST API is a set of remote calls using standard methods to request and return data in a specific format between two systems. 

Pulsar provides a variety of REST APIs that enable you to interact with Pulsar to retrieve information or perform an action.
