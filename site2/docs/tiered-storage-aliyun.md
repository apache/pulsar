title: Use Aliyun OSS offloader with Pulsar
sidebar_label: "Aliyun OSS offloader"
---

This chapter guides you through every step of installing and configuring the Aliyun Object Storage Service (OSS) offloader and using it with Pulsar.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install the Aliyun OSS offloader.

### Prerequisite

- Pulsar: 2.8.0 or later versions

### Steps

1. [Download the Pulsar tarball](getting-started-standalone.md#download-pulsar-distribution).
2. Download and untar the Pulsar offloaders package, then copy the Pulsar offloaders as `offloaders` in the Pulsar directory. See [Install tiered storage offloaders](tiered-storage-overview.md#how-to-install-tiered-storage-offloaders).

## Configuration

:::note

Before offloading data from BookKeeper to Aliyun OSS, you need to configure some properties of the Aliyun OSS offload driver. Besides, you can also configure the Aliyun OSS offloader to run it automatically or trigger it manually.

:::

### Configure Aliyun OSS offloader driver

You can configure the Aliyun OSS offloader driver in the configuration file `broker.conf` or `standalone.conf`.

- **Required** configurations are as below.

  | Required configuration | Description | Example value |
  | --- | --- |--- |
  | `managedLedgerOffloadDriver` | Offloader driver name, which is case-insensitive. | aliyun-oss |
  | `offloadersDirectory` | Offloader directory | offloaders |
  | `managedLedgerOffloadBucket` | [Bucket](#bucket-required) | pulsar-topic-offload |
  | `managedLedgerOffloadServiceEndpoint` | [Endpoint](#endpoint-required) | http://oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com |

- **Optional** configurations are as below.

  | Optional | Description | Default value |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `managedLedgerOffloadReadBufferSizeInBytes` | Block size for each individual read when reading back data from S3-compatible storage. | 1 MB |
  | `managedLedgerOffloadMaxBlockSizeInBytes` | Maximum block size sent during a multi-part upload to S3-compatible storage. It **cannot** be smaller than 5 MB. | 64 MB |
  | `managedLedgerMinLedgerRolloverTimeMinutes` | Minimum time between ledger rollover for a topic.<br /><br />It's **not** recommended to change the default value in a production environment. | 2 |
  | `managedLedgerMaxEntriesPerLedger` | Maximum number of entries to append to a ledger before triggering a rollover.<br /><br />**Note**: It's **not** recommended to change the default value in a production environment. | 5000 |

#### Bucket (required)

A bucket is a basic container that holds your data. Everything you store in Aliyun OSS must be contained in a bucket. You can use a bucket to organize your data and control access to your data, but unlike a directory and folder, you cannot nest a bucket.

##### Example

This example names the bucket `pulsar-topic-offload`.

```conf
managedLedgerOffloadBucket=pulsar-topic-offload
```

#### Endpoint (required)

The endpoint is the region where a bucket is located.

:::tip

For more information about Aliyun OSS regions and endpoints,  see [International website](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/31837.htm) or [Chinese website](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/31837.html).

:::


##### Example

This example sets the endpoint as `oss-us-west-1-internal`.

```conf
managedLedgerOffloadServiceEndpoint=http://oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com
```

#### Authentication (required)

To be able to access Aliyun OSS, you need to authenticate with Aliyun OSS.

Set the environment variables `ALIYUN_OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ALIYUN_OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` in `conf/pulsar_env.sh`.

```bash
export ALIYUN_OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ABC123456789
export ALIYUN_OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=ded7db27a4558e2ea8bbf0bf37ae0e8521618f366c
```

:::note

Exporting these environment variables makes them available in the environment of spawned processes.

### Run Aliyun OSS offloader automatically

Namespace policy can be configured to offload data automatically once a threshold is reached. The threshold is based on the size of data that a topic has stored in a Pulsar cluster. Once the topic reaches the threshold, an offloading operation is triggered automatically.

| Threshold value | Action |
| --- | --- |
| > 0 | It triggers the offloading operation if the topic storage reaches its threshold. |
| = 0 | It causes a broker to offload data as soon as possible. |
| < 0 | It disables automatic offloading operation. |

Automatic offloading runs when a new segment is added to a topic log. If you set the threshold on a namespace, but few messages are being produced to the topic, the offloader does not work until the current segment is full.

You can configure the threshold size using CLI tools, such as [`pulsar-admin`](/tools/pulsar-admin/).

The offload configurations in `broker.conf` and `standalone.conf` are used for the namespaces that do not have namespace-level offload policies. Each namespace can have its offload policy. If you want to set an offload policy for a specific namespace, use the command [`pulsar-admin namespaces set-offload-policies options`](/tools/pulsar-admin/) command.

#### Example

This example sets the Aliyun OSS offloader threshold size to 10 MB using `pulsar-admin`.

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin namespaces set-offload-threshold --size 10M my-tenant/my-namespace
```

:::tip

For more information about the `pulsar-admin namespaces set-offload-threshold options` command, including flags, descriptions, and default values, see [Pulsar admin docs](/tools/pulsar-admin/).

### Run Aliyun OSS offloader manually

For individual topics, you can trigger the Aliyun OSS offloader manually using one of the following methods:

- Use REST endpoint.

- Use CLI tools, such as [`pulsar-admin`](/tools/pulsar-admin/).

  To trigger it via CLI tools, you need to specify the maximum amount of data (threshold) that should be retained in a Pulsar cluster for a topic. If the size of the topic data on the Pulsar cluster exceeds this threshold, segments from the topic are moved to Aliyun OSS until the threshold is no longer exceeded. Older segments are moved first.

#### Example

- This example triggers the Aliyun OSS offloader to run manually using `pulsar-admin`.

  ```bash
  bin/pulsar-admin topics offload --size-threshold 10M my-tenant/my-namespace/topic1
  ```

  **Output**

  ```bash
  Offload triggered for persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace/topic1 for messages before 2:0:-1
  ```

  :::tip

  For more information about the `pulsar-admin topics offload options` command, including flags, descriptions, and default values, see [Pulsar admin docs](/tools/pulsar-admin/).

  :::

- This example checks the Aliyun OSS offloader status using `pulsar-admin`.

  ```bash
  bin/pulsar-admin topics offload-status persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace/topic1
  ```

  **Output**

  ```bash
  Offload is currently running
  ```

  To wait for the Aliyun OSS offloader to complete the job, add the `-w` flag.

  ```bash
  bin/pulsar-admin topics offload-status -w persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace/topic1
  ```

  **Output**

  ```bash
  Offload was a success
  ```

  If there is an error in offloading, the error is propagated to the `pulsar-admin topics offload-status` command.

  ```bash
  bin/pulsar-admin topics offload-status persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace/topic1
  ```

  **Output**

  ```
  Error in offload
  null
