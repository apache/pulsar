When acknowledging out of order, a consumer leaves holes that are supposed to be quickly filled by acknowledging all the messages. The information of which messages are acknowledged is persisted by compressing in "ranges" of messages that were acknowledged. After the max number of ranges is reached, the information is only tracked in memory and messages are redelivered in case of crashes.        | 10000                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
