This document describes how to use the Pulsar Perf for performance testing. For detailed information about performance tuning, see [here](https://streamnative.io/whitepaper/taking-a-deep-dive-into-apache-pulsar-architecture-for-performance-tuning/).

## Pulsar Perf

The Pulsar Perf is a built-in performance test tool for Apache Pulsar. You can use the Pulsar Perf to test message writing or reading performance.

### Produce messages

This example shows how the Pulsar Perf produces messages with default options. For all configuration options available for the `pulsar-perf produce` command, see [configuration options](#configuration-options-for-pulsar-perf-produce).

```
bin/pulsar-perf produce my-topic

```

After the command is executed, the test data is continuously output on the Console.

**Output**

```

```

From the above test data, you can get the throughput statistics and the write latency statistics. The aggregated statistics is printed when the Pulsar Perf is stopped. You can press **Ctrl**+**C** to stop the Pulsar Perf. After the Pulsar Perf is stopped, the [HdrHistogram](http://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/) formatted test result appears under your directory. The document looks like `perf-producer-1589370810837.hgrm`. You can also check the test result through [HdrHistogram Plotter](https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html). For details about how to check the test result through [HdrHistogram Plotter](https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html), see [HdrHistogram Plotter](#hdrhistogram-plotter).

### Configurations

By default, the Pulsar Perf uses `conf/client.conf` as the default configuration and uses `conf/log4j2.yaml` as the default Log4j configuration. If you want to connect to other Pulsar clusters, you can update the `brokerServiceUrl` in the client configuration.

You can use the following commands to change the configuration file and the Log4j configuration file.

```
export PULSAR_CLIENT_CONF=<your-config-file>
export PULSAR_LOG_CONF=<your-log-config-file>

```

In addition, you can use the following command to configure the JVM configuration through environment variables:

```
export PULSAR_EXTRA_OPTS='-Xms4g -Xmx4g -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=4g'

```

## HdrHistogram Plotter

The [HdrHistogram Plotter](https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html) is a visualization tool for checking Pulsar Perf test results, which makes it easier to observe the test results.

To check test results through the HdrHistogram Plotter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the HdrHistogram repository from GitHub to the local.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram.git

    ```

2. Switch to the HdrHistogram folder.

    ```
    cd HdrHistogram

    ```
3. Install the HdrHistogram Plotter.

    ```
    mvn clean install -DskipTests

    ```
4. Transform the file generated by the Pulsar Perf.

    ```
    ./HistogramLogProcessor -i <hgrm file path that pulsar-perf generated> -o <output file>

    ```

5. You will get two output files. Upload the output file with the filename extension of .hgrm to the [HdrHistogram Plotter](https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html).

6. Check the test result through the Graphical User Interface of the HdrHistogram Plotter, as shown blow.
