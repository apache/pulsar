# Pulsar Client Generated Docs

Pulsar's Python docs used to be generated for every wesbite build, but this is unnecessary. We now generate
the docs for each version by running the [build-docs-in-docker.sh](./build-docs-in-docker.sh) script in this
directory.

## Example

When starting in the root directory of the project, you can run:

```shell
PULSAR_VERSION=2.8.3 ./site2/tools/python-client/build-docs-in-docker.sh
```
