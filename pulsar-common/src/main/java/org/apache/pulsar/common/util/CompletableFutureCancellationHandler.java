/**
 * Implements cancellation and timeout support for CompletableFutures.
 * <p>
 * This class ensures that the cancel action gets called once after the future completes with
 * either {@link CancellationException} or {@link TimeoutException}.
 * The implementation handles possible race conditions that
 * might happen when the future gets cancelled before the cancel action is set to this handler.
 * <p>
 * For timeouts, CompletableFuture's "orTimeout" method introduced in JDK9
 * can be used in client code.
 * <p>
 * Cancellation and timeout support will only be active on the future where the
 * cancellation handler has been attached to. Cancellation won't happen if .cancel is called on
 * any "downstream" dependent futures. A cancellation or timeout that happens in any "upstream"
 * future will get handled.
