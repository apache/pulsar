# PIP-243: Register Jackson Java 8 support modules by default

Jackson has a separate Java 8 support modules for adding support for proper serialization and deserialization of new classes that were added in Java 8 (Java 8 was released in 2014).

These Jackson Java 8 support modules haven't been used in the Pulsar code base. This is a pity. This causes a lot of pain when using Java Time classes in Pulsar applications or Pulsar Functions. There are ways to get the classes working for applications, but the documentation is missing. It would make things easier if the Java 8 support modules for Jackson would be included and registered by default.
