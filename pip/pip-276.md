# Motivation

The metrics are all started with `pulsar_`, so that both users and operators can quickly find the metrics of the entire system through this prefix. However, due to some other reasons, 
it was found that `topic_load_times` was missing the prefix, so want to get it right.

# High Level Design

In master branch, keep the old metric `topic_load_times` and add below new metrics:

* `pulsar_topic_load_times`

After release-3.1.0, remove ``topic_load_times`.


### Metrics

Add new metrics:

* `pulsar_topic_load_times` : The topic load latency calculated in milliseconds

# Monitoring

After this PIP, users can use `topic_load_times` and `pulsar_topic_load_times` to monitor topic load times.
