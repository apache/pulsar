# PIP-374: Expose the Admin client configs: readTimeout, requestTimeout, connectionTimeout

# Background knowledge

- `pulsar-admin sinks create` will upload files to brokers, but if the file is large and the network is slow, it may cost a long time.
- The default value of `requestTimeout` of Admin API is `60s`, after the fix https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23128, it was changed to `300s`.

# Motivation

We'd better to expose the following configs to users:
- `readTimeout`
- `requestTimeout`
- `connectionTimeout`

# Goals

Expose the Admin client configs: `readTimeout`, `requestTimeout` and `connectionTimeout` to users.

# Detailed Design

### CLI

**client.conf**
```properties
adminReadTimeoutInSeconds=300
adminRequestTimeoutInSeconds=300
adminConnectionTimeoutInSeconds=300
```
