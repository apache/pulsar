# PIP-447: Customizable Prometheus Labels for Topic Metrics

# Abstract

This PIP proposes a mechanism to selectively expose existing Pulsar Topic Properties as Prometheus metrics labels. Instead of introducing a new mechanism for custom labels, Administrators will define a set of allowed property keys at the broker level. If a topic has a property matching one of these allowed keys, its value will be automatically sanitized and injected as a Prometheus label. This enables granular metric filtering and alerting using the metadata users are already maintaining, while managing cardinality through centralized configuration.

# Motivation

Currently, Pulsar topic metrics exposed to Prometheus have a fixed set of labels: cluster, namespace, and topic. This limits users' ability to categorize topics for alerting and dashboarding based on custom criteria (e.g., SLA tier, data sensitivity, application owner) that are not easily expressed through topic names alone. Relying on regular expressions (regex) applied to the topic label in Prometheus for such grouping is often complex, inefficient, and error-prone.

This limitation can lead to:

Imprecise Alerting: Difficulty in setting distinct alerting thresholds for different categories of topics.

Alert Fatigue or Missed Alerts: Overly broad or overly complex alerting rules.

Operational Overhead: Increased effort in managing and maintaining Prometheus alert configurations.

Users require a native Pulsar mechanism to inject queryable, custom metadata directly into topic metrics to improve alerting precision, simplify dashboarding, and enhance overall observability.

Users often already attach this metadata to topics using Topic Properties (e.g., sla_tier=gold, owner=team_a). However, these properties are currently invisible to the monitoring layer.

# Goals

## In Scope

The primary goals of this proposal are to:

* Allow administrators to define a configurable list of allowed topic property keys in the broker configuration.

* Update the Prometheus metrics generation logic to retrieve values from the existing Topic Properties map and inject them as labels if they match the allowed list.

* Provide robust control over Prometheus metric cardinality by strictly enforcing the allowed-list.

# High Level Design

Configuration Implementation: Add parameters to broker.conf to define the allow-list (e.g., allowedTopicPropertiesForMetrics).

Metrics Generation Modification: Update the PrometheusMetricsServlet (or equivalent exporter) to:

* Read the topic's existing properties.

* Filter keys against the configured allow-list.

* Append them to the outgoing Prometheus metric lines.

# Detailed Design

## Design & Implementation Details

### Topic Property Storage: 
We utilize the existing Map<String, String> properties in TopicPolicies. No new storage is needed.

### Metrics Generation Logic:
The Prometheus metrics generation component in the broker (e.g., PrometheusMetricsServlet) will be modified.

If `exposeCustomTopicMetricLabelsEnabled` is true, for each topic. The broker iterates over the allowedTopicPropertiesForMetrics list. For each allowed key, it checks if the topic has a corresponding property value. If found, the sanitized key and the original value are added as a label to the metric family.

## Public-facing Changes

### Configuration

The following new configuration parameters will be introduced in broker.conf:

exposeCustomTopicMetricLabelsEnabled=(true|false)

Description: Enables or disables the custom topic metric labels feature.

Default: false

allowedTopicPropertiesForMetrics=<key1>,<key2>,...

Description: A comma-separated list of Topic Property keys that are allowed to be exposed as metrics. Only keys explicitly listed here will be exposed.

Default: Empty string (if the feature is enabled but no keys are defined, no custom metric labels can be exposed).

### Public API

# Backward & Forward Compatibility

## Backward Compatibility

Disabled by Default: The feature will be disabled by default (exposeCustomTopicMetricLabelsEnabled=false). 

Existing Pulsar deployments will see no change in behavior or metric format.

No Impact if Unused: If the feature is enabled but allowedTopicPropertiesForMetrics is not configured or no labels are set on topics, metrics will remain unchanged.

Existing APIs: Existing pulsar-admin commands and REST APIs are unaffected.

## Forward Compatibility

Prometheus Systems: If a Pulsar broker with this feature enabled sends metrics with custom metric labels to an older Prometheus server or a monitoring system not expecting these additional labels, those systems will typically ignore the extra labels without issue.

Future Enhancements: Future Pulsar versions could extend this feature, for example, by allowing more dynamic management of allowedTopicPropertiesForMetrics if deemed safe and necessary.

OpenTelemetry Alignment: The key-value structure of custom metric labels aligns well with OpenTelemetry attributes, ensuring that this feature remains relevant and compatible with Pulsar's evolving metrics infrastructure.

# Testing Plan

A comprehensive testing strategy will be required:

Test the filtering logic against allowedTopicPropertiesForMetrics.

Integration Tests:

Verify correct setting, getting, and removing of custom metric labels via admin tools and REST APIs.

Test validation logic for allowed keys.

End-to-End Flow: Set a property via pulsar-admin topics update-properties, scrape the metrics endpoint, and verify the label appears.

Dynamic Updates: Verify that updating a property value changes the metric label value in subsequent scrapes.

Removal: Verify that removing a property removes the label.

# Documentation Plan

The official Apache Pulsar documentation will be updated to include:

Concepts Section: Explanation of the custom topic metric labels feature, its purpose, and how it helps with monitoring and alerting.

Instructions on how to enable and configure the feature in broker.conf (e.g., exposeCustomTopicMetricLabelsEnabled, allowedTopicPropertiesForMetrics, and other limits).

Best practices for defining allowedTopicPropertiesForMetrics with cardinality management in mind.

Monitoring Section: Notes on how these custom metric labels appear in Prometheus and how they can be used in PromQL queries, along with reminders about cardinality considerations for the Prometheus system.

# Alternatives

Briefly, two other approaches were considered and rejected:

A. Single Composite Tag Label:

Description: Exposing a list of user-defined tags as a single, comma-separated string label (e.g., custom_tags="tagA,tagB,tagC").

Reason for Rejection: This approach can lead to extremely high cardinality of the label value itself if tag combinations are diverse. It also necessitates complex and less performant regex queries in Prometheus and loses the semantic key-value structure.

B. Prometheus Relabeling with External Metadata:

Description: Keeping Pulsar metrics unchanged and using Prometheus's relabel_configs to enrich metrics with labels from an external metadata source (e.g., a file or a separate API).

Reason for Rejection: This shifts the implementation complexity and maintenance burden to the Prometheus configuration and external systems. It introduces risks of stale metadata and potential performance overhead on Prometheus. Crucially, it is not a Pulsar-native solution, which is the aim of this proposal.

C. Store label in topic policy

Description: Instead of using topic properties, we can store the custom metric labels in topic policies.

Reason for Rejection: Storing labels in topic policies adds complexity to the topic management and requires additional code to handle the policy updates.
