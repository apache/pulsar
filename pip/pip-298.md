## Background

In the implementation of the Pulsar Transaction, each topic is configured with a `Transaction Buffer` to prevent consumers from reading uncommitted messages, which are invisible until the transaction is committed. Transaction Buffer works with Position (maxReadPosition) and `TxnID` Set (aborts). The broker only dispatches messages, before the maxReadPosition, to the consumers. When the broker dispatches the messages before maxReadPosition to the consumer, the messages sent by aborted transactions will get filtered by the Transaction Buffer.

## Motivation

Currently, Pulsar transactions do not have configurable isolation levels. By introducing isolation level configuration for consumers, we can enhance the flexibility of Pulsar transactions.

## Goal

### In Scope

Implement Read Committed and Read Uncommitted isolation levels for Pulsar transactions.Allow consumers to configure isolation levels during the building process.

### Out of Scope

None.

## API Changes

Update the PulsarConsumer builder process to include isolation level configurations for Read Committed and Read Uncommitted.

### Before the Change

The PulsarConsumer builder process currently does not include isolation level configurations. The consumer creation process might look like this:

```
PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.builder().serviceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650").build();

Consumer<String> consumer = client.newConsumer(Schema.STRING)
        .topic("persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace/my-topic")
        .subscriptionName("my-subscription")
        .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Shared)
        .subscribe();
```

### After the Change

Update the PulsarConsumer builder process to include isolation level configurations for Read Committed and Read Uncommitted. Introduce a new method isolationLevel() in the consumer builder, which accepts an enumeration value representing the isolation level:

```
public enum IsolationLevel {
    READ_COMMITTED,
    READ_UNCOMMITTED
}
```

Then, modify the consumer creation process to include the new isolation level configuration:

```
PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.builder().serviceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650").build();

Consumer<String> consumer = client.newConsumer(Schema.STRING)
        .topic("persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace/my-topic")
        .subscriptionName("my-subscription")
        .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Shared)
        .subscriptionIsolationLevel(IsolationLevel.READ_COMMITTED) // Adding the isolation level configuration
        .subscribe();
```

With this change, users can now choose between Read Committed and Read Uncommitted isolation levels when creating a new
consumer. If the isolationLevel() method is not called during the builder process, the default isolation level will be
Read Committed.
Note that this is a subscription dimension configuration, and all consumers under the same subscription need to be
configured with the same IsolationLevel.

## Implementation

### Client Changes

Update the PulsarConsumer builder to accept isolation level configurations for Read Committed and Read Uncommitted levels.

In order to achieve the above goals, the following modifications need to be made:

- Added `IsolationLevel` related fields and methods in `ConsumerConfigurationData` and `ConsumerBuilderImpl` and `ConsumerImpl`

- Modify PulsarApi.CommandSubscribe, add field -- IsolationLevel

```
message CommandSubscribe {

    enum IsolationLevel {
    READ_COMMITTED = 0;
    READ_UNCOMMITTED = 1;
    }
    optional IsolationLevel isolation_level = 20 [default = READ_COMMITTED];
}
```

### Broker changes

Modify the transaction buffer and dispatching mechanisms to handle messages based on the chosen isolation level.

In order to achieve the above goals, the following modifications need to be made:

- Determine in the `readMoreEntries` method of Dispatchers such as `PersistentDispatcherSingleActiveConsumer` and `PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers`:

    - If Subscription.isolationLevel == ReadCommitted, then MaxReadPosition = topic.getMaxReadPosition(), that is, transactionBuffer.getMaxReadPosition()

    - If Subscription.isolationLevel == ReadUnCommitted, then MaxReadPosition = PositionImpl.LATEST
