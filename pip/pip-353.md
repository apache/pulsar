# PIP-353: Improve transaction message visibility for peek-messages cli

## Background knowledge

This PIP addresses enhancements message visibility for the peek-message CLI, specifically related to transaction messages and markers. 
Currently, when peeking messages, users may encounter `server internal marker` and `uncommitted` or `aborted` for transaction message, 
which should typically be hidden to ensure data integrity and consistency.

### Transaction Markers
Transaction markers are internal messages used by Pulsar to denote the start, end, and status (commit/abort) of a transaction. They are not meant to be consumed by clients.

Similarly, other [internal markers](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/ed5d94ccfdf4eba77678454945a2c3719dce2268/pulsar-common/src/main/proto/PulsarMarkers.proto#L25-L38) 
used by Pulsar for various system operations should also not be visible to clients as they could lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the data.

### Transaction Messages
- Uncommitted Messages: These should not be visible to consumers until the transaction is committed.
- Aborted Messages: These should be filtered out and never made visible to consumers.

## Motivation

The current implementation exposes all messages, including transaction markers and messages from uncommitted or aborted transactions, when peeking.
This behavior can confuse users and lead to incorrect data handling. The proposal aims to provide more control over what types of messages are visible during message peeking operations.

## Goals

### In Scope

- Implement flags to selectively display `server markers`, `uncommitted messages`, and `aborted messages` in peek operations.
- Set the default behavior to only show messages from committed transactions to ensure data integrity.

### Out of Scope
- Any modifications to the core transaction handling mechanism.
- Any changes to consumer logic.

## High Level Design

The proposal introduces three new flags to the `peek-messages` command:

1. `--show-server-marker`: Controls the visibility of server markers (default: `false`).
2. `--show-txn-uncommitted`: Controls the visibility of messages from uncommitted transactions (default: `false`).
3. `--show-txn-aborted`: Controls the visibility of messages from aborted transactions (default: `false`).

These flags will allow administrators and developers to tailor the peek functionality to their needs, improving the usability and security of message handling in transactional contexts.

## Detailed Design

### Design & Implementation Details

To support the `--show-server-marker` and `--show-txn-aborted` flags, needs to introduce specific tag into the `headers` of messages returned by the 
[peekNthMessage REST API](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/8ca01cd42edfd4efd986f752f6f8538ea5bf4f94/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/admin/v2/PersistentTopics.java#L1892-L1905). 
These tag will identify whether a message is `server marker` or is `aborted for transaction`.

Then, In the CLI, these markers can be used to determine whether to filter out these messages and proceed to the next one. For an implementation example, 
see the following code: [https://github.com/shibd/pulsar/pull/34](https://github.com/shibd/pulsar/pull/34)

For the `--show-txn-uncommitted` flag, it is necessary to modify the [`PersistentSubscription.peekNthMessage`](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/57a616eaa79096af5b49db89c99cd39ccc94ec00/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentSubscription.java#L895).
This modification should ensure that the method only reads up to the `maxReadPosition` maintained by the transaction, thereby preventing the reading of uncommitted messages.

### Public-facing Changes

#### CLI Command Flags

New command line flags added for the `bin/pulsar-admin topics peek-messages` command:

| Flag                     | Abbreviation | Type    | Default | Description                                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------|---------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--show-server-marker`   | `-ssm`       | Boolean | `false` | Enables the display of internal server write markers.          |
| `--show-txn-uncommitted` | `-stu`       | Boolean | `false` | Enables the display of messages from uncommitted transactions. |
| `--show-txn-aborted`     | `-sta`       | Boolean | `false` | Enables the display of messages from aborted transactions.     |

## Backward & Forward Compatibility

### Revert
Reverting to a previous version of Pulsar without this feature will remove the additional flags from the CLI. Users who prefer the new behavior will need to manually adjust their usage patterns when reverting.

### Upgrade
While upgrading to the new version of Pulsar that includes these changes, the default behavior of the `peek-messages` command will change.
Existing scripts or commands that rely on the old behavior (where transaction markers and messages from uncommitted or aborted transactions are visible) will need to explicitly set the new flags (`--show-server-marker`, `--show-txn-uncommitted`, `--show-txn-aborted`) to `true` to maintain the old behavior. 
This change is necessary as the previous default behavior did not align with typical expectations around data visibility and integrity in transactional systems.
