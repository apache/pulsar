## Motivation
`Reader` belongs to exclusive subscription type, and it uses `nonDurable` cursor. After receiving messages, `Reader` will ack cumulatively immediately.
The `flowPermits` are triggered in multiple scenarios from the client side and it is isolated from `seek` of `Consumer`. Therefore, it is possibile that `flowPermits` will execute after `seek` from the client side, like the following flow chart.

When `handleSeek` processing is delay from the server side, the `MarkDelete position` is modified in a wrong way.
The expected result is that `Reader`can re-consume messages from `mark delete:(1,1)` after `seek`. But it doesn't work.

Pulsar read message and seek position is not a synchronous operation, the seek request can't prevent an in-process entry reading operation. The client-side also has an opportunity to receive messages after the seek position.

Pulsar client make read messages operation and seek position operation synchronized so add an epoch into server and client consumer.  After client reader consumer invoke `seek` , the epoch increase 1 and send `seek`  command carry the epoch and then server consumer will update the epoch. When dispatcher messages to client will carry the epoch which the cursor read at the time. Client consumer will filter the send messages command which is smaller than current epoch. 
In this way, after the client consumer send `seek` command successfully, because it has passed the epoch filtering, the consumer will not receive a message with a messageID greater than the user previously seek position.


### Current implementation details
#### CommandSeek Protocal
```proto
// Reset an existing consumer to a particular message id
message CommandSeek {
    required uint64 consumer_id = 1;
    required uint64 request_id  = 2;

    optional MessageIdData message_id = 3;
    optional uint64 message_publish_time = 4;
}
```
### CommandMessage
```proto
message CommandMessage {
    required uint64 consumer_id       = 1;
    required MessageIdData message_id = 2;
    optional uint32 redelivery_count  = 3 [default = 0];
    repeated int64 ack_set = 4;
    optional uint64 epoch = 5 [default = 0];
}
```
`CommandMessage` already add epoch by [PIP-84](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-84-:-Pulsar-client:-Redeliver-command-add-epoch) , when client receive `CommandMessage` will compare the command epoch and local epoch to handle this command.

## Goal
Add epoch into seek command.
 
## API Changes
### Protocal change: CommandSeek
```proto
// Reset an existing consumer to a particular message id
message CommandSeek {
    required uint64 consumer_id = 1;
    required uint64 request_id  = 2;

    optional MessageIdData message_id = 3;
    optional uint64 message_publish_time = 4;
    optional uint64 consumer_epoch = 5;
}
```
`CommandSeek` command add epoch field, when client send seek command to server successfully, the server will change the server consumer epoch to the command epoch. The epoch only can bigger than the old epoch in server. Now the client can filter out the message which contains less consumer epoch.

## Implementation
- stage 1: Check the current cursor status when handling flowPermits from the server side.
- stage 2: Add epoch into seek command, and server update the consumer epoch. It can prevent an in-process entry reading operation after the seek request.

## Reject Alternatives
None yet.

## Note
1. Consumer reconnect need reset epoch.
