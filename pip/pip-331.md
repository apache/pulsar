# PIP-331: Replace configuration `brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneLoopTimeInSeconds` with `brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneReadTimeoutInSeconds`

# Background knowledge

Configuration `brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneLoopTimeInSeconds` is defined as the total timeout of phase one.
```commandline
    @FieldContext(
            category = CATEGORY_SERVER,
            doc = "Timeout for the compaction phase one loop, If the execution time of the compaction "
                    + "phase one loop exceeds this time, the compaction will not proceed."
    )
    private long brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneLoopTimeInSeconds = 30;
```
However, current implementation just set a timeout for a single message read operation, which is different with the meaning of `brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneLoopTimeInSeconds`.


# Motivation

As we can't predict the number of messages need to be read in phase one, it's hard to set a proper timeout for a single message read operation.
So it's good to set a timeout for one single message read operation which is predictable.
So we can deprecate `brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneLoopTimeInSeconds` and introduce `brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneReadTimeoutInSeconds` to replace it.

# Goals
### Configuration

```commandline
    @Deprecated
    @FieldContext(
            category = CATEGORY_SERVER,
            deprecated = true,
            doc = "Timeout for the compaction phase one loop, If the execution time of the compaction "
                    + "phase one loop exceeds this time, the compaction will not proceed."
                    + "@deprecated - Use brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneLoopReadTimeoutInSeconds instead" +
                    "to control the timeout for each read request."
    )
    private long brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneLoopTimeInSeconds = 30;

    @FieldContext(
            category = CATEGORY_SERVER,
            doc = "Timeout for each read request in the compaction phase one loop, If the execution time of one "
                    + "single message read operation exceeds this time, the compaction will not proceed."
    )
    private long brokerServiceCompactionPhaseOneLoopReadTimeoutInSeconds = 30;
```
