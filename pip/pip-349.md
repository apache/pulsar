# PIP-349: Add systemCursorNames ignore list for ttl check

# Background knowledge

In Pulsar topic, we have [retention policy](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.2.x/cookbooks-retention-expiry/#retention-policies) to control the acknowledged message lifetime. For the unacknowledged messages, we have a separate mechanism to control the message lifetime, which is called [`TTL`](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.2.x/cookbooks-retention-expiry/#time-to-live-ttl). The `TTL` is a time-to-live value for the message, which is controlled by `ttlDurationDefaultInSeconds`. The message will be automatically acknowledged if it is not consumed within the `TTL` value.

# Motivation

In Pulsar, we have two kinds of topics, system topic and normal topic. The system topics are used for internal purposes, such as transaction internal topics. The system topics are not supposed to be consumed by the users. However, the system topics are still subject to the `TTL` check. If the system topics are not consumed within the `TTL` value, the messages in the system topics will be automatically acknowledged. This is not the expected behavior for the system topics and may lead to data loss.
For normal topics, we also has two kinds of subscriptions, system subscription and normal subscription. The system subscription is used for internal purposes, such as compaction service or third-party plugins. The system subscription is not supposed to be used by the users. However, the system subscription is still subject to the `TTL` check. If the system subscription is not consumed within the `TTL` value, the messages in the system subscription will be automatically acknowledged. This is not the expected behavior for the system subscription.

We had one PR [#21865](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21865) to filter the compaction service cursors for TTL check, but it doesn't cover other system cursors. To provide a general solution and support third-party plugin cursors not impacted by TTL, I proposed to add a systemCursorNames ignore list to filter the TTL check.

# Goals

## In Scope

Add a systemCursorNames ignore list to filter the TTL check for system subscriptions.

# Detailed Design

## Design & Implementation Details

Add a systemCursorNames ignore list to filter the TTL check for system subscriptions. The systemCursorNames ignore list is an optional configuration, and the default configuration contains compaction service subscription. Pulsar broker will filter the TTL check for the systemCursorNames subscriptions.

# Backward & Forward Compatibility

This change is fully compatible.
