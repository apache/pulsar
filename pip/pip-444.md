# PIP-444: Rate limit for deleting ledger to alleviate the zk pressure.

# Background knowledge

Apache Pulsar uses Apache BookKeeper as its storage layer. 
Each topic consists of multiple ledgers, which are created periodically based on the configuration.
Each ledger corresponds to a ZooKeeper (ZK) node for metadata storage. When a ledger is deleted, the corresponding ZK node will also be deleted.
Retention policies determine how long messages are retained in a topic. When the retention period is reached, the corresponding ledgers will be deleted.

# Motivation

When the retention of a large topic is reduced, a significant number of ledgers need to be deleted.
Since this deletion operation is not rate-limited, it could results in ZooKeeper (ZK) latency of several minutes,
which threatens the stability of the entire Pulsar cluster.

# Goals

Add rate limit feature for deleting ledgers.

# Detailed Design

Introduce two new configuration parameters:
```
@FieldContext(
    category = CATEGORY_STORAGE_ML,
    doc = "Rate limit the amount of deleting ledgers per second at broker level," +
    "value of 0 or negative means no rate limit"
)
private double managedLedgerDeleteRateLimit = 1000.0;

@FieldContext(
    category = CATEGORY_STORAGE_ML,
    doc = "Concurrency level for deleting ledgers at broker level when rate limiting is enabled"
)
private int managedLedgerDeleteConcurrency = 5;
```
These parameters can be configured in the `broker.conf` file.

When the `managedLedgerDeleteRateLimit` is set to a value greater than 0, the broker will limit the rate of ledger deletions to the specified value per second.
The `managedLedgerDeleteConcurrency` parameter specifies the number of concurrent threads that can be used for deleting ledgers when rate limiting is enabled.


# Backward & Forward Compatibility

Fully backward compatible and forward compatible.

## Upgrade

New feature is enabled by default with a rate limit of 1000 deletions per second and concurrency of 5.

## Downgrade / Rollback

To downgrade or rollback, simply revert the configuration changes in the `broker.conf` file and restart the broker.
