# PIP-313: Support force unsubscribe using consumer api

# Motivation

As discussed in Issue: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/21451

Apache Pulsar provides a messaging queue using a Shared subscription to process unordered messages in parallel using multiple connected consumers. Shared subscription is also commonly used in data processing pipelines where they need to forcefully unsubscribe from the subscription after processing messages on the topic. One example is Pulsar-Storm adapter where [Pulsar spout](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/branch-2.4/pulsar-storm/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/storm/PulsarSpout.java#L126) creates Pulsar consumers on a shared subscription for distributed processing and then unsubscribe on the topic. 

However, PulsarSpout always fails to unsubscribe shared subscriptions and it also doesn't close the pulsar consumers if there is more than one consumer connected to the subscription which causes a leaked subscription and consumer for that application. It also causes a backlog on a topic due to failed unsubscribe and application team has to build external service to just address such failures.

In this usecases, client application can not successfully unsubscribe on a shared subscription when multiple consumers are connected because Pulsar client library first tries to unsubscribe which will not be successful as multiple consumers are still connected on the subscription and eventually Pulsar client lib fails to unsubscribe and close the consumer on the subscription. Because of that none of the consumers can disconnect or unsubscribe from the subscription. This will make it impossible for applications to unsubscribe on a shared subscription and they need an API to forcefully unsubscribe on a shared subscription using consumer API.
We already have the admin-api to unsubscribe forcefully but adding such support in consumer API will allow applications like Pulsar-storm to unsubscribe successfully and also allow consumers to close gracefully.

# Goals

Support unsubscribe API with force option in consumer API along with admin API which can help applications to unsubscribe on various subscriptions such as Failover, Shared, Key-Shared.

# High Level Design

Consumer API will have additional unsubscribe api with additional flag to enable forceful unsubscribe on a subscription. Pulsar client library will pass the flag to broker while unsubscribing and broker will use it with existing broker side implementation of ubsubscribing forcefully.


## Design & Implementation Details

### (1) Pulsar client library changes

Add support of unsubscribe api with force option in Consumer API

```
Consumer.java

void unsubscribe(boolean force) throws PulsarClientException;
CompletableFuture<Void> unsubscribeAsync(boolean force);
```

Calling unsubscribe with force flag will make broker to fence the subscription and disconnect all the consumers forcefully to eventually unsubscribe and delete the subscription. However, reconnection of the consumer can recreate the subscription so, client application should make sure to call force-unsubscribe from all the consumers to eventually delete subscription or disable auto subscription creation based on application usecases.

### (2) Protobuf changes

Pulsar client library will pass an additional force flag (with default value =false) to the broker with wire protocol change

```
PulsarApi.proto

message CommandUnsubscribe {
    required uint64 consumer_id   = 1;
    required uint64 request_id    = 2;
    optional bool force           = 3 [default = false];
}
```

### (3) Broker changes

Broker already supports force delete subscription using admin-api so, broker already has implementation to unsubscribe forcefully but it doesnâ€™t have option to trigger using binary api. Therefore, once client sends additional force flag to broker while unsubscribing , broker reads the flag and passes to the subscription API to forcefully unsubscribe the subscription.


# Security Considerations
<!--
A detailed description of the security details that ought to be considered for the PIP. This is most relevant for any new HTTP endpoints, new Pulsar Protocol Commands, and new security features. The goal is to describe details like which role will have permission to perform an action.

An important aspect to consider is also multi-tenancy: Does the feature I'm adding have the permissions / roles set in such a way that prevent one tenant accessing another tenant's data/configuration? For example, the Admin API to read a specific message for a topic only allows a client to read messages for the target topic. However, that was not always the case. CVE-2021-41571 (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/CVE-2021-41571) resulted because the API was incorrectly written and did not properly prevent a client from reading another topic's messages even though authorization was in place. The problem was missing input validation that verified the requested message was actually a message for that topic. The fix to CVE-2021-41571 was input validation. 

If there is uncertainty for this section, please submit the PIP and request for feedback on the mailing list.
