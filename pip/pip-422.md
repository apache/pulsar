# PIP-422: Support global topic-level policy: replicated clusters and new API to delete topic-level policies

# Background knowledge

Users have two choices of config metadata store when using the feature Geo-Replication: shared or not.
All clusters share data that are stored in global config metadata store if users choose to use a shared metadata store.
By the way, the share config metadata store often is build crossing multi zone/region to ensure fault tolerance.

Since the data that are stored in the shared metadata store contains the following pulsar resources: tenants, namespaces, partitioned topic,
the Admin API can not be used to delete these pulsar resources for a single cluster.
Pulsar has a feature that used to delete namespace level resources for a specify cluster when using a shared metadata store, it works as follows:
- The original namespace-level policy that named `replicated clusters` contains two clusters `c1` and `c2`.
- The topics under the cluster `c1` will be deleted automatically when users remove `c1` from the namespace-level policy.

The feature above very useful at the following scenarios:
- Transfer a namespace from a old cluster to a new cluster: at last, the namespace should be deleted from the old cluster.
- Delete topics: since Pulsar does not allow deleting topics when enabled Geo-Replication, users should disable replication first.

# Motivation

When using shared metadata store and enabled Geo-Replication, there is no mechanism for the following scenarios:
- Transfer a partitioned topic from a old cluster to a new cluster.
- Delete a partitioned topic from a specify cluster.

Passed solutions:
1. Disable namespace-level Geo-Replication then delete the partitioned topic: this will trigger a deletion for other topics, which is not expected.
2. Disable topic-level Geo-Replication under each cluster, and delete the partitioned topic by Admin API: it will delete the shared partitioned topic metadata, which was also deleted from another cluster.
3. Disable topic-level Geo-Replication under each cluster, and delete the sub-topics manually by Admin API: this is the best solution without the current PIP, the defect is that the schema data and topic-level policies are still there.

# Goals & Designs

Add two new APIs
- `pulsar-admin topicPolicies -c <clusters> --g <topic>`
  -  Pulsar only support setting a local topic-level `replicated clusters`, does not support global policies so far.
- `pulsar-admin topicPolicies delete <topic>`
  - To delete topic level policies, including global and local policies, it can be called even if the topic has been deleted.

The new APIs will be used for the following scenarios:

A. Delete a partitioned topic under all clusters, if enabled Geo-Replication with a shared config metadata store.
- Disable global topic level `replicated clusters`, in other words, set `replicated clusters` with a single list.
  - The clusters are not contained in the `replicated clusters` will delete the sub-topics automatically, such as the namespace-level implementation.
  - The schemas and local topic policies of the topic will be deleted after the latest sub-topic is deleted.
- Delete partitioned topic since we have disabled Geo-Replication.
- Manually delete global topic-level policies by the new API `pulsar-admin topicPolicies delete <topic>` for other clusters that are not contained in `replicated clusters`.

B. Delete a partitioned topic under a specify cluster.
- Support setting up a global topic-level `replicated clusters` policy , which does not contain the cluster that you want to remove form. 
  - Broker will delete the sub-topics automatically.
  - The schemas and local topic policies of the topic will be deleted after the latest sub-topic is deleted.
- Note:
  - The global topic-level policy will not be removed, to avoid the namespace-level `replicated cluster` being taken affect.
  - Once you want to delete the topic under all clusters, please use the solution A to remove the global topic-level policy left.

**Question**: why not to add a mechanism that brokers clear global topic-level policies that the related topic was deleted regularly, which avoids to call `pulsar-admin topicPolicies delete <topic>`?

**Answer**: When users quickly delete and create topics, it will result in the previous policies not being deleted by the scheduled cleaning mechanism, thereby causing confusion.
