# PIP-293: Support reader to read compacted data

# Motivation

There is a config in ServiceConfiguration called `disableBrokerInterceptors` introduced by [#8157](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8157), which seems to disable the broker interceptor, but is commented for testing only.
Actually, whether to enable the interceptor depends on whether the broker is loaded into the interceptors. [#10489](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/10489) kept the same implementation.
But [#20422](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20422) has changed the behavior, it uses `disableBrokerInterceptors` to judge whether to enable the interceptor, which caused an NPE issue mentioned in [#20710](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20710).
This `disableBrokerInterceptors` config is very confusing, so we decide to delete it.

# Goals

Delete config `disableBrokerInterceptors`.
