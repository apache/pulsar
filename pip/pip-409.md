# PIP-409: support producer configuration for retry/dead letter topic producer

# Background knowledge

Retry topic is a topic that stores messages that have failed to be processed by the consumer, or the consumer can't process the message at the moment. 
The consumer can retry the message after a certain period of time. After several retries, the message will be moved to the dead letter topic.

There is a retry topic producer in consumer instance. Each time the consumer call `consumer.reconsumeLater(msg, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);` 
to retry the message after 3 seconds, the hidden producer will send the corresponding message to retry topic, and ack the message in original topic.

After several retries, the message will be sent to dead letter topic instead of retry topic.


# Motivation

Currently, we don't support configure the producer of retry/dead letter topic. But enable the chunk message feature
and disable the batch configuration in hard code, which can't handle many situations. For example, when the throughput 
of message of retry topic become considerable, the resource consumed by the un-batched messages is pretty large. 
There is no reason that we disable the batch message feature.

For better control for the retry/dead letter topic feature, we can support configuration for the producer of 
retry/dead letter topic.

# Goals

## In Scope

- Support configuration for the producer of retry/dead letter topic.


# Detailed Design

## Design & Implementation Details

- Add two new configurations in `DeadLetterPolicy`:
```java
public class DeadLetterPolicy implements Serializable {
  /**
   * Function to build the producer for the retry letter topic.
   * The input parameter is the topic name.
   */
  private Function<String, ProducerBuilder<byte[]>> retryLetterProducerBuilder;

  /**
   * Function to build the producer for the dead letter topic.
   * The input parameter is the topic name.
   */
  private Function<String, ProducerBuilder<byte[]>> deadLetterProducerBuilder;
}
```

- use the `retryLetterProducerBuilder` to build the producer for retry topic, and use the
`deadLetterProducerBuilder` to build the producer for dead letter topic.


# Backward & Forward Compatibility

Fully compatible.
