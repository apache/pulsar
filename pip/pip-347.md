# PIP-347: add role field in consumer's stat

# Background knowledge

During the operation and maintenance process, there are many users asking administrator for help to find out the consumers of a topic and notify them about the business change.
Administrators can call `bin/pulsar-admin topics partitioned-stats` to find out the `ip:port` of the consumers, but no role info. So administrators need to take a lot of time to
communicate with users to find out the owner based on the `ip:port`. It's a troublesome work and low efficiency.

# Motivation

This pip can help to solve such kind of problem. By adding a field `role` in the consumer's stat, the administrator can find out the owner of the consumer directly. 
It can save a lot of time and improve the efficiency of the operation and maintenance process.

# Goals

- help administrator to find out the owner of the consumer

# Detailed Design

## Design & Implementation Details
- Add a field `role` in the consumer's stat to show the owner of this consumer.
- For some use cases, the role info is sensitive, so we only expose the role info when the cli tool option `--expose-role` is set
  and the user is a super-user or a tenant admin.

## Public-facing Changes

### CLI
Add a new option `--expose-role` for command `bin/pulsar-admin topics partitioned-stats` 
and `bin/pulsar-admin topics stats` to show the role info of the consumer.


# Backward & Forward Compatibility

Fully compatible.
