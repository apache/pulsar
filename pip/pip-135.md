# PIP-135: Include MetadataStore backend for Etcd

Since all the pieces that composed the proposal in PIP-45 were finally merged
and are currently ready for 2.10 release, it is now possible to add other
metadata backends that can be used to support a BookKeeper + Pulsar cluster.

One of the popular systems that is most commonly used in alternative of
ZooKeeper is Etcd, thus it makes sense to have this as the first non-zookeeper
implementation.

## Goal

Provide a Etcd implementation for the `MetadataStore` API. This will allow
users to deploy Pulsar clusters using Etcd service for the metadata and it will
not require the presence of ZooKeeper.


## Implementation

 * Use the existing JEtcd Java client library for Etcd
 * Extends the `AbstractBatchedMetadataStore` class, in order to reuse the
   transparent batching logic that will be shared with the ZookKeeper
   implementation.
