# PIP-394: Add two interfaces `CursorMetadataSerializerProvider` and `CursorMetadataDeSerializerProvider` to support newer of customized cursor metadata serializations

# Background knowledge

**1. What does cursor metadata contain**

- cursor properties.
- entry id that indicates the latest persist cursor metadata into.
- information of individual acknowledged messages, we call it `individualDeletedMessages`.
- information of individual acknowledged batched messages, we call it `batchedEntryDeletionIndexInfo`.

**2. The improvements we did for the persistence for cursor metadata**
- https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/758: skip to information that over the max limitation of max ranges to persist.
- https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/14529: compress the info when persisting.
- https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9292: add a new compression strategy: change Range Objects to `long[]`.

# Motivation

**Issue-1: Compatible of improvements**

- The third improvement was contributed with `release:4.0`, which is a new LTS version.
    - It changed the default implementation of serialization that contains https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9292.
- Users can not rollback to `3.0.x` once upgraded to `4.0.x` because `release:3.0.x` does not contain the deserialization that introduced by https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9292.

**Issue-2: Frequently Young GC relates to the cursor metadata persistence if there are too many active subscriptions in a broker, even if we did so many improvements**

`individualDeletedMessages` and `batchedEntryDeletionIndexInfo` often is the largest attributes of the metadata. They are serialized to a proto data when being persisted. But we can not recycle the object which typed proto due to it is immutable.

# Goals

- Guarantee compatability for rollback from `4.0.x` to `3.0.x`.
  - This PIP will be cherry-picked into `branch-3.0` and `branch-3.3`. 
- Support customized cursor metadata serializer to improve the issues users encountered, such as **Issue-1** in the Motivation.

# High Level Design

### Design

- We call the serialization that implemented before `4.0.0` `V1`, and call after the https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9292 `v2`.
- Add all version of serialization into `branch-3.0`.
  - Set the default value of `3.0.x` is `V1`, which is the same as the current status. 
  - Set the default value of `4.0.x` is `V1`, which is the same as the current status.
- Add two interfaces `CursorMetadataSerializerProvider` and `CursorMetadataDeSerializerProvider` to support newer of customized cursor metadata serializations.

### Public API

**CursorMetadataSerializerProvider.java**
```java
CursorMetadataSerializer newProvider(Name, PulsarService);
```

**CursorMetadataDeSerializerProvider.java**
```java
CursorMetadataDeserializer newProvider(Name, PulsarService);
```

**CursorMetadataSerializer.java**
```java
ManagedCursorInfo serialize(Position markDeletePosition,
        Map<String, Long> properties,
        LongPairRangeSet<Position> individualDeletedMessages,
        Map<Position, BitSetRecyclable> batchDeletedIndexes);
```

**CursorMetadataDeserializer.java**
```java
ManagedCursorInfo deserialize(ByteBuf data);
```

### Public-facing Changes & Binary protocol
- If you used your customized `CursorMetadataSerializer`, it may break the tools who will read cursor ZK node, such as the tool `pulsar-managed-ledger-admin`.

### Configuration

**broker.conf**
```properties
cursorMetadataSerializerProvider=V2
cursorMetadataDeserializerProvider=V1,V2
```

### InScope and out of Scope

This PIP will only add the interfaces named `CursorMetadataSerializerProvider` and `CursorMetadataDeSerializerProvider`, the implementations other than `V1` and `V2` will not be provided.

# Backward & Forward Compatibility

## Upgrade

Nothing to do.

## Downgrade / Rollback

- I will cherry-pick this PIP into `branch-3.0` and `branch-3.3`.
- Since https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9292 changed the cursor metadata serialization. Once you upgraded to `4.0.x` from a lower version, you can only downgrade to the version that contains the current PIP.
