# PIP-322: Pulsar Rate Limiting Refactoring

# Motivation

The current rate limiting implementation in Apache Pulsar has several known issues that impact performance and accuracy when operating Pulsar clusters under load (detailed in [Problems to Address](#problems-to-address)). This proposal outlines a refactor to consolidate multiple existing options into a single improved solution.

The refactor aims to resolve numerous user complaints regarding default Pulsar rate limiting being unusable. In addition, inconsistencies and thread contention with existing rate limiters cause unpredictable throttling and added latency.  

Overhauling the built-in implementation will improve multi-tenancy, allow Pulsar to scale to demanding workloads, and address longstanding issues.

# Goals

## In Scope

- Preserve current functionality without breaking changes

### Problems to Address  

- High CPU load with default rate limiter 
- Netty thread contention adding latency  
- Multiple limiting implementations (default, precise) which unnecessarily expose implementation details to users of Pulsar and make the code harder to maintain and improve
- Inability to limit throughput consistently when using default rate limiter

## Out of Scope

- Custom/pluggable rate limiters
- Additional rate limiting features
- Cluster-wide capacity management
- Addressing the shared connection multiplexing problem where throttling multiple independent streams multiplexed on the same connection cannot be consistently throttled by pausing reads on the server side.

# High Level Design

The proposed refactor will overhaul rate limiting internals while preserving existing APIs and user-facing behavior. A token bucket algorithm will provide efficient and accurate calculations to throttle throughput. 

Multiple built-in options such as "precise" rate limiter will be consolidated under a single solution. 
Performance issues caused by contention and CPU overhead will be addressed.

# Detailed Design

## Proposed Solution

- Use asynchronous token bucket algorithm
  - Efficient for concurrent updates
    - Can be implemented in a lockless, non-blocking way using CAS fields. 
  - Conceptually simple
  - Common traffic shaping approach   
- Unify rate limiting implementations
  - Consolidate the multiple built-in rate limiting options like "default" and "precise" into a single unified implementation.  
- Improve understandability, code quality and maintainability. 
- Use more non-blocking asynchronous code and get rid of synchronized methods which are causing issues such as #21442.

### Preserve Public Contracts

- Avoid breaking existing configs, APIs or client functionality.
- Handle through internal refactoring.  

## Public-facing Changes

There are no changes to existing configs, CLI options, monitoring etc. 
This PIP is about a large change which includes a major refactoring and multiple improvements and bug fixes to rate limiting.
