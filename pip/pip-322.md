# PIP-322: Pulsar Rate Limiting Refactoring

# Motivation

The current rate limiting implementation in Apache Pulsar has several
known issues that impact performance and accuracy when operating Pulsar
clusters under load (detailed in [Problems to
Address](#problems-to-address)). This proposal outlines a refactor to
consolidate multiple existing options into a single improved solution.

The refactor aims to resolve numerous user complaints regarding default
Pulsar rate limiting being unusable. In addition, inconsistencies and
thread contention with existing rate limiters cause unpredictable
throttling and added latency.

Refactoring the built-in implementation will improve multi-tenancy,
allow Pulsar to scale to demanding workloads, and address longstanding
issues.

Rate limiters act as a conduit to more extensive capacity management and
Quality of Service (QoS) controls in Pulsar. They are integral to
Pulsar's core multi-tenancy features. This refactoring will pave the way
for future enhancements.

# Goals

## In Scope

- Preserve current functionality without breaking changes
- Consolidate the multiple existing rate limiting options into a single,
  configurable rate limiting solution
- Remove the separate “precise” rate limiter

### Problems to Address  

- High CPU load with default rate limiter
- High lock contention that impacts shared Netty IO threads and adds
  latency to unrelated Pulsar topic producers ([[Bug] RateLimiter lock
  contention when use precise publish rate limiter
  #21442](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/21442).)
- Multiple limiting implementations (default, precise) which
  unnecessarily expose implementation details to users of Pulsar and
  make the code harder to maintain and improve
- Inability to limit throughput consistently when using default rate
  limiter
- Inconsistent behavior across multiple levels of throttling (broker,
  namespace, connection)
- Code maintainability
  - Improve understandability of code

## Out of Scope

- Custom/pluggable rate limiters
- Additional rate limiting features
- Cluster-wide capacity management
- Addressing the shared connection multiplexing problem where throttling
  multiple independent streams multiplexed on the same connection cannot
  be consistently throttled by pausing reads on the server side.

# Current solution

## Rate limiters in Pulsar

In Pulsar, rate limiters are used for a few cases:
  - publisher rate limiting
    - topic level (configured at namespace level or topic level policy
      with admin api)
    - broker level (configured in broker.conf)
    - resource group level (configured with resource groups admin api)
  - dispatcher rate limiting
  - subscribe rate limiting
  - namespace bundle unloading rate limiting

For producers ("publishers"), there are addition conditions to throttle,
besides the rate limiters:
  - limiting pending publish requests per connection, configured with
    `maxPendingPublishRequestsPerConnection`` in broker configuration
  - limiting memory for publishing messages, configured with
    `maxMessagePublishBufferSizeInMB`` in broker configuration

### Current publisher rate limiters in Pulsar

Pulsar contains two implementations for publisher rate limiters:
"default" and "precise". "precise" is the rate limiter implementation
which is used when the broker is configured with
`preciseTopicPublishRateLimiterEnable=true` in broker.conf.

#### Default publisher rate limiter

In this approach, a sub-second scheduler runs (configured with
`brokerPublisherThrottlingTickTimeMillis`, defaults to 50ms), iterating
every topic in the broker and checking if the topic has exceeded its
threshold. If so, it will toggle the autoread state of the connection
for the client's producer. Concurrently, a separate one-second scheduler
resets the counters and re-enables throttled connections. This method
results in inaccurate rate limiting. Additionally, this approach can
result in increased CPU usage due to the operation of two schedulers
which are constantly iterating all topics and toggling autoread states.

#### Precise publisher rate limiter

In this approach, the rate limit check is done on every send messages
request and thus the rate limiting is enforced more accurately. This
fixes the main issues of the default rate limiters. However, it
introduces a lock contention problem since the rate limiter
implementation extensively uses synchronous methods. Since this lock
content happens on Netty IO threads, it impacts also unrelated topics on
the same broker and causes unnecessary slowdowns as reported by bug
#21442.

### Publisher Throttling Approach

In the Pulsar binary protocol, the broker's only method of applying
backpressure to the client is to pause reads and allow the buffers to
fill up. There is no explicit protocol-level, permit-based flow control
as there is for consumers.

When the broker throttles a producer, it needs to pause reading on the
connection that the client's producer is using. This is achieved by
setting the Netty channel's autoread state to false.

The broker cannot reject a message that is already in progress. Pausing
reading on the connection prevents the broker from receiving new
messages and this throttles publishing. When reading is paused, Netty
channel and OS-level TCP/IP buffers will fill up and eventually signal
backpressure on the TCP/IP level to the client side.

In the current solution, when the rate limit is exceeded, the autoread
state is set to false for all producers. Similarly, when the rate falls
below the limit, the autoread state is set to true. When the
broker-level limit is exceeded or falls below the limit, all producers
in the entire broker are iterated. At the topic level, it's for all
producers for the topic. In the resource group, it's all producers part
of the resource group.

This current solution threfore spends CPU cycles to iterate through the
producers and toggle the autoread flags. It's not necessary to eagerly
iterate all producers in a publisher rate limiter. Rate limiting can
also be achieved when producers are lazily throttled only after they
have sent a publishing send request
([CommandSend](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/next/developing-binary-protocol/#command-send))
to the broker. 

It's perfectly acceptable to throttle only active producers one by one
after new messages have arrived when the rate limit has been exceeded.
The end result is the same: the target rate can be kept under the limit.
The calculated rate is always an average rate over a longer period of
time. This is true in both the existing solution and the proposed
solution. Over a very short time span, the observed rate can be
extremely high. This all smoothens out when the rate calculation spans
over hundreds of milliseconds or longer periods. This is why it's
perfectly fine to throttle producers as they produce messages. The
proposed solution accounts all traffic in the rate limiter since the
state is preserved over the rate limiting period (1 second) and isn't
resetted as it is in the current solution which will miss accounting for
traffic around the boundary when the limit has exceeded, but the
connections haven't yet been paused. That's yet another reason why the
lazy approach is suitable for the new proposed solution.

The externally observable behavior of the rate limiting is actually
better than before since it is possible to achieve fairness in a
producer throttling solution that is implemented in this approach.
Fairness is a general property that is expected in resource sharing
approaches such that each resource consumer is given a similar share of
the resource. In the current publisher rate limiting solution, there's
no way to achieve fairness when the rate limit is being exceeded. In the
proposed solution, fairness is achieved by using a queue to track which
producer is given a turn to produce while the rate limit has been
exceeded and producers are throttled. If the rate limit is again
exceeded, the producer will be put back into the queue and wait for its
turn until it can produce again. In the current solution, the producers
are iterated in the order that they appear in the broker's registry. The
producers at the beginning get more chances to produce than the ones
that are further down the list. The impact of this is the lack of
fairness.

# High-Level Design

The proposed refactor will refactor rate limiting internals while
preserving existing user-facing public APIs and user-facing behavior. A
token bucket algorithm will provide efficient and accurate calculations
to throttle throughput.

Multiple built-in options such as "precise" rate limiter will be
consolidated under a single solution. Performance issues caused by
contention and CPU overhead will be addressed.

# Detailed Design

## Proposed Solution

### Using an asynchronous token bucket algorithm

Token bucket algorithms are a common industry practice for handling
traffic shaping. It is well understood and it's conceptually simple. A
token bucket is simply a counter which is limited to a maximum value,
the token bucket's capacity. New tokens are added to the bucket with the
configured rate. The usage consumes tokens from the token bucket. When
the token bucket is empty, the usage should be backpressured. In use
cases where the already accepted work cannot be rejected, the token
value needs to also go to negative values.

Since token bucket algorithm is essentially a counter where new tokens
are added based on the time that has passed since the last token update,
it is possible to implement this algorithm in Java in a lockless,
non-blocking way using compare-and-swap (CAS) operations on volatile
fields. There is no need for a scheduler to add new tokens since the
amount of new tokens to add can be calculated from the time that has
passed. This assumption has already been validated in the
https://github.com/lhotari/async-tokenbucket repository. 

There's no current intention to use async-tokenbucket as a separate
library. The AsyncTokenBucket class will be placed directly in the
Pulsar code base. The reason to have async-tokenbucket repository
separately is to have more detailed performance benchmarks there and a
PoC of the high performance.

The purpose of the proof-of-concept async-tokenbucket was to ensure that
it has an extremely low overhead which makes it feasible to calculate
the amount of tokens in an eventually consistent manner with a
configurable resolution, without a scheduler. The token bucket
operations won't become a bottleneck since on a Dell XPS 2019 i9 laptop
the benchmark showed about 900M token bucket ops/s and on MBP 2023 M3
Max it was around 2500M token bucket ops/s.

Internally AsyncTokenBucket uses an eventual consistent approach to
achieve high performance and low overhead. The new tokens and consumed
tokens are updated to the token value with a configurable resolution
which is 16 milliseconds by default. On the "fast path", a JVM LongAdder
is used to keep the sum of the pending consumed tokens. These get
subtracted from the total amount on the next update. 

Key methods in AsyncTokenBucket:
- `consumeTokens()`: Consumes given number of tokens
- `consumeTokensAndCheckIfContainsTokens()`: Consumes given number of
  tokens and checks if any tokens remain
- `containsTokens()`: Checks if any tokens remain
- `calculateThrottlingDuration()`: Computes how long throttling should
  last until the token bucket contains at least 16 milliseconds worth of
  tokens filled with the configured rate.

Due to the eventual consistent nature of AsyncTokenBucket, the strongly
consistent value of tokens could be off by 16 milliseconds (configured
resolution) of consumption. This is not a problem since when the
throttling finally happens, the strongly consistent value is used for
throttling period calculations and no consumed tokens are missed in the
calculations since the token value can go to negative values too. The
average rate will smoothen out to meet the target rate of the rate
limiter with this eventual consistent solution and it doesn't impact the
externally observable behavior.

For unit tests, eventual consistent behavior can be a challenge. For
that purpose, it's possible to switch the AsyncTokenBucket class to a
strongly consistent mode for unit tests by calling static
`switchToConsistentTokensView` and
`resetToDefaultEventualConsistentTokensView` methods on the class.

One notable improvement of AsyncTokenBucket is that it is completely
non-blocking and lockless. Using AsyncTokenBucket as the basis for
publishing rate limiters in Pulsar will address a severe performance
bottleneck in Pulsar with the "precise" rate limiter. This is reported
as[[Bug] RateLimiter lock contention when use precise publish rate
limiter #21442](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/21442).

### Unifying rate limiting implementations and improving code maintainability

In the proposed solution there's no need for separate "default" and
"precise" rate limiting options. A single implementation will be used.
This improves understandability, code quality and maintainability. 

### Fixing the inconsistency of multiple levels of throttling

In Pulsar throttling can happen for producers in 5 different ways
simultaneously: publisher rate limiting happens at 3 levels: broker,
topic, resource group and in addition there's backpressure for limiting
number of pending publish requests and limiting memory used for
publishing. (detailed in [Rate limiters in
Pulsar](#rate-limiters-in-pulsar)).

When there are 5 different simultaneuos conditions for throttling a
connection, the connection should be throttled as long as any of these
conditions is present. In the current code base, this handling is error
prone and complex. There are also cases where one rate limiter sets the
autoread to false and another immediately sets it to true although the
connection should remain throttled as long as one of the conditions
exists.

The fix for this issue is in the proposal by introducing a new concept
ServerCnxThrottleTracker, which will track the "throttle count". When a
throttling condition is present, the throttle count is increased and
when it's no more present, the count is decreased. The autoread should
be switched to false when the counter value goes from 0 to 1 and only
when it goes back from 1 to 0 should it set to true again. The autoread
flag is no more controlled directly from the rate limiters. Rate
limiters are only responsible for their part and it's
ServerCnxThrottleTracker that decides when autoread flag is toggled.

### Preserve Public Contracts

- Avoid breaking existing configs, APIs or client functionality.
- Handle through internal refactoring.  

## Public-facing Changes

There are no changes to existing configs, CLI options, monitoring etc.
This PIP is about a large change which includes a major refactoring and
multiple improvements and bug fixes to rate limiting.

## More Detailed Level Design

Please refer directly to [the pull request with the proposed
changes](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21681) for the more
detailed level changes.

The implementation level detail questions can be handled in the pull
request review. The goal is to document low level details directly in
the Javadoc and comments so that it serves the code maintainers also in
the future.
