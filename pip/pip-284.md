# Background knowledge

1. Apache pulsar introduced the topic-level policy by [PIP-39](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-39%3A-Namespace-Change-Events).
It was using reader API to read messages and load the event into the local cache.

2. Apache pulsar introduced new consumer type - table view by [PIP-104](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/12356) 
   which can make the topic as a table by key and save it in the memory.

# Motivation

Since we have already implemented a table view, we can try to refactor topic policies service
using the table view component to avoid complex logic.

# Goals

## In Scope

- Refactor existing system topic-based topic policies service from reader API to table view API.

# Backward & Forward Compatibility

There are no backwards compatibility issues because we use the same topic as before.
