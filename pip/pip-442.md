# PIP-442: Add memory limits for CommandGetTopicsOfNamespace and CommandWatchTopicList on Broker and Proxy

## Background Knowledge

Apache Pulsar brokers provide commands for clients to discover topics within a namespace and watch for topic updates.
These commands are critical for client operations but currently lack memory limits and flow control mechanisms,
creating potential memory and stability issues at scale.

### Existing Broker Memory Management

Pulsar brokers already implement comprehensive memory management for most operations through several key configurations:

**Message Publishing Memory Limits:**
- `maxMessagePublishBufferSizeInMB` (default: 50% direct memory): Limits memory used for buffering messages during publishing, providing backpressure when producers exceed broker capacity

**Managed Ledger Memory Limits:**
- `managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightSizeInMB` (default: 0, disabled): Controls memory allocation for concurrent read operations from BookKeeper, preventing excessive memory usage during high read loads. This limit extends to cover buffers that were read from BookKeeper and are waiting in channel outbound buffers to be written to client sockets. 
- `managedLedgerCacheSizeMB` (default: 20% of direct memory): Limits cache memory for recently read ledger entries, ensuring predictable memory usage for read caching. This limit extends to cover buffers that were read from the cache and are waiting in channel outbound buffers to be written to client sockets. 

**Additional Memory Controls:**
- `maxConcurrentLookupRequest` (default: 50000): Limits concurrent topic lookup requests. The unit of this limit is the number of requests; it is not expressed in memory size.
- `maxConcurrentTopicLoadRequest` (default: 5000): Controls concurrent topic loading operations. The unit of this limit is the number of requests; it is not expressed in memory size.

These existing limits effectively bound memory usage for message handling, storage operations, and most broker functions. However, there is a significant gap in memory management for topic discovery operations.

### The Memory Management Gap

Major unbounded memory allocation in Pulsar brokers occurs during topic listing operations:

- `CommandGetTopicsOfNamespace` / `CommandGetTopicsOfNamespaceResponse`
- `CommandWatchTopicList` / `CommandWatchTopicListSuccess` & `CommandWatchTopicUpdate`

These operations can allocate arbitrary amounts of memory based on namespace size, with no limits or backpressure mechanisms.

### Key Components

**Topic Discovery Commands:**
- **`CommandGetTopicsOfNamespace`**: Binary protocol command that retrieves all topics within a namespace
- **`CommandGetTopicsOfNamespaceResponse`**: Response containing the list of topics
- **`CommandWatchTopicList`**: Command to establish a watch for topic list changes
- **`CommandWatchTopicListSuccess`**: Initial response confirming watch establishment and returning current topic list
- **`CommandWatchTopicUpdate`**: Notifications sent when topics are added or removed

**Current Implementation Flow:**

The `getTopicsOfNamespace` request follows this path:

1. **Client Request**: Sends `CommandGetTopicsOfNamespace` via binary protocol
2. **Request Handling**: 
   - Broker: `ServerCnx.handleGetTopicsOfNamespace()` 
   - Proxy: `ProxyConnection.handleGetTopicsOfNamespace()`
3. **Topic Retrieval**: `NamespaceService.getListOfUserTopics()` orchestrates:
   - Fetches persistent topics from `TopicResources`
   - Retrieves non-persistent topics from local cache or peer clusters
   - Filters system topics using `TopicList.filterSystemTopic()`
   - Implements caching via `inProgressQueryUserTopics` to prevent duplicate queries
4. **Response Construction**: Packages results with hash calculation and filtering metadata
5. **Response Transmission**: Sends complete response back to client

### The Unbounded Memory Problem

Unlike other broker operations that have memory limits, topic listing operations create unbounded memory allocation scenarios:

**Memory Allocation Points:**
1. **Topic List Assembly**: When retrieving topics from metadata store, the entire list is materialized in heap memory
2. **Response Object Creation**: The complete topic list is serialized into a response object
3. **Network Buffers**: Netty allocates direct memory for the serialized response
4. **Proxy Buffering**: Proxy deserializes broker response then re-serializes for client

**Scale Impact:**
- Namespace with 10,000 topics Ã— 100 bytes average topic name = ~1MB per response
- With 1000 concurrent requests: ~1GB memory pressure

## Motivation

The lack of memory limits for topic listing commands creates the final significant gap in Pulsar's otherwise comprehensive memory management system:

1. **Memory Management Consistency**: While all other broker operations have memory limits and backpressure mechanisms, topic listing operations remain unbounded, creating an inconsistent and unpredictable memory profile.

2. **Broker Memory Exhaustion Risk**: Large clusters can trigger OutOfMemoryErrors when multiple clients simultaneously request topic lists, causing broker crashes and service disruption despite other memory controls being in place.

3. **Proxy Memory Exhaustion Risk**: Proxies are also impacted for `CommandGetTopicsOfNamespace` since the request is forwarded to a broker and the response is deserialized and reserialized without limits.

4. **Unpredictable Resource Usage**: Operators cannot reliably predict or limit total broker or proxy memory consumption due to this unbounded allocation path, undermining capacity planning and resource management.

5. **Performance Degradation**: Even without OOM, large topic list operations cause GC pressure and latency spikes affecting all broker operations, counteracting the stability provided by other memory limits.

## Goals

### In Scope

- Close the memory management gap by implementing configurable memory limits for topic listing operations
- Add memory-based flow control and backpressure for both `CommandGetTopicsOfNamespace` and `CommandWatchTopicList` commands
- Provide separate limits for heap and direct memory consumption, consistent with existing broker memory management patterns
- Ensure fairness through queueing mechanisms when memory limits are reached
- Add comprehensive metrics for monitoring and alerting, similar to existing memory limit metrics
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing clients

### Out of Scope

- Pagination or streaming of topic lists (requires protocol changes)
- Compression of topic list responses (separate optimization)
- Changes to topic discovery semantics or filtering capabilities
- Memory limits for other broker commands (already covered by existing configurations)

## High-Level Design

The solution introduces an `AsyncDualMemoryLimiter` that acts as a memory-aware semaphore for topic listing operations, completing Pulsar's memory management framework:

1. **Memory Tracking**: Before processing requests or sending responses, the system estimates memory requirements and acquires permits from the limiter. When the permit cannot be estimated and allocated before the operation, an initial permit is acquired and updated before continuing with handling. Although not optimal, this will effectively limit memory usage across the broker.

2. **Dual Memory Pools**: Separate tracking for heap memory (topic list assembly) and direct memory (network buffers) with independent limits, since topic listing operations use both types of memory.

3. **Asynchronous Backpressure**: When memory limits are reached, requests queue with configurable timeouts rather than failing immediately, providing graceful degradation similar to `managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightSizeInMB` behavior. This type of solution is helpful since rejecting requests and requiring clients to retry can cause more load on the system and would cause unfair queueing. When the queue is completely full, requests are rejected.

4. **Graceful Degradation**: The system continues processing within memory limits rather than crashing, with clear metrics indicating when memory-based throttling occurs.

5. **Release Guarantees**: Memory permits are released after response transmission completes or on request failure, preventing memory leaks and ensuring accurate memory tracking.

## Detailed Design

### Design & Implementation Details

#### AsyncSemaphore Interface

This is an abstraction for a generic asynchronous semaphore. The memory limiter implementation will use this abstraction to implement separate limiters for heap and direct memory.

```java
public interface AsyncSemaphore {
    /**
     * Acquire permits from the semaphore.
     * Returned future completes when permits are available.
     * It will complete exceptionally with AsyncSemaphorePermitAcquireTimeoutException on timeout
     * and exceptionally with AsyncSemaphorePermitAcquireQueueFullException when queue full
     * @return CompletableFuture that completes with permit when available
     */
    CompletableFuture<AsyncSemaphorePermitResult> acquire(long permits);

    /**
     * Acquire or release permits for previously acquired permits by updating the permits.
     * Returns a future that completes when permits are available.
     * It will complete exceptionally with AsyncSemaphorePermitAcquireTimeoutException on timeout
     * and exceptionally with AsyncSemaphorePermitAcquireQueueFullException when queue full
     * @return CompletableFuture that completes with permit when available
     */
    CompletableFuture<AsyncSemaphorePermit> update(AsyncSemaphorePermit permit, long newPermits);
    
    /**
     * Release previously acquired permit.
     * Must be called to prevent memory permit leaks.
     */
    void release(AsyncSemaphorePermit permit);
}
```

#### AsyncDualMemoryLimiter Interface

This is an abstraction for an asynchronous memory semaphore that tracks separate limits for heap and direct memory.

```java
public interface AsyncDualMemoryLimiter {
    enum LimitType {
        HEAP_MEMORY,    // For heap memory allocation
        DIRECT_MEMORY   // For direct memory allocation
    }
    
    /**
     * Acquire permits for the specified memory size.
     * Returned future completes when memory permits are available.
     * It will complete exceptionally with AsyncSemaphorePermitAcquireTimeoutException on timeout
     * and exceptionally with AsyncSemaphorePermitAcquireQueueFullException when queue full
     * @return CompletableFuture that completes with permit when available
     */
    CompletableFuture<AsyncDualMemoryLimiterPermit> acquire(long memorySize, LimitType limitType);

    /**
     * Acquire or release permits for previously acquired permits by updating the requested memory size.
     * Returns a future that completes when permits are available.
     * It will complete exceptionally with AsyncSemaphorePermitAcquireTimeoutException on timeout
     * and exceptionally with AsyncSemaphorePermitAcquireQueueFullException when queue full
     * @return CompletableFuture that completes with permit when available
     */
    CompletableFuture<AsyncDualMemoryLimiterPermit> update(AsyncDualMemoryLimiterPermit permit, long newMemorySize);
    
    /**
     * Release previously acquired permit.
     * Must be called to prevent memory permit leaks.
     */
    void release(AsyncDualMemoryLimiterPermit permit);
}
```

#### Integration Points

**1. Heap Memory Limiting (Post-Retrieval)**

In `ServerCnx.handleGetTopicsOfNamespace`:

```java
// Acquire a fixed amount of permits initially since it's not known how much memory will be used
// This will ensure that the operation continues only after it has the initial permits
// It would be possible to use statistics for initial estimate, but this is simpler and sufficient
maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.acquire(INITIAL_SIZE, AsyncDualMemoryLimiter.LimitType.HEAP_MEMORY)
    .thenCompose(initialPermit -> {
        getBrokerService().pulsar().getNamespaceService().getListOfUserTopics(namespaceName, mode)
            .thenCompose(topics -> {
                // Estimate memory after retrieval and update the permits to reflect the actual size
                long estimatedSize = topics.stream().mapToInt(String::length).sum();
                return maxTopicListInFlightLimiter
                    .update(initialPermit, estimatedSize)
                    .thenApply(permit -> Pair.of(topics, permit));
            })
            .thenAccept(topicsAndPermit -> {
                try {
                    // Process and send response
                    ...
                } finally {
                    maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.release(topicsAndPermit.getRight());
                }
            });
        ...
    // For exceptional paths, initialPermit would need to be released
```

**2. Direct Memory Limiting (Pre-Serialization)**

Modified `CommandSender` implementation:

```java
@Override
public void sendGetTopicsOfNamespaceResponse(List<String> topics, String topicsHash,
                                             boolean filtered, boolean changed, long requestId) {
    BaseCommand command = Commands.newGetTopicsOfNamespaceResponseCommand(topics, topicsHash,
            filtered, changed, requestId);
    safeIntercept(command, cnx);
    acquireMaxTopicListInFlightPermitsAndWriteAndFlush(command);
}

private void acquireMaxTopicListInFlightPermitsAndWriteAndFlush(BaseCommand command) {
    // Calculate serialized size before acquiring permits
    int serializedSize = command.getSerializedSize();
    // Acquire permits
    maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.acquire(serializedSize, AsyncDualMemoryLimiter.LimitType.DIRECT_MEMORY)
            .thenAcceptAsync(permits -> {
                try {
                    // Serialize the response
                    ByteBuf outBuf = Commands.serializeWithPrecalculatedSerializedSize(command, serializedSize);
                    // Write the response
                    cnx.ctx().writeAndFlush(outBuf).addListener(future -> {
                        // Release permits after the response has been written to the socket
                        maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.release(permits);
                    });
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    // Return permits if an exception occurs before writeAndFlush is called successfully
                    maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.release(permits);
                    throw e;
                }
            }, cnx.ctx().executor());
}
```

**3. Watch Command Memory Control**

Similar memory limiting patterns apply to watch commands:

```java
public void sendWatchTopicListSuccess(long requestId, long watcherId, String topicsHash, List<String> topics) {
    BaseCommand command = Commands.newWatchTopicListSuccess(requestId, watcherId, topicsHash, topics);
    acquireMaxTopicListInFlightPermitsAndWriteAndFlush(command);
}

public void sendWatchTopicListUpdate(long watcherId, List<String> newTopics, List<String> deletedTopics, String topicsHash) {
    BaseCommand command = Commands.newWatchTopicUpdate(watcherId, newTopics, deletedTopics, topicsHash);
    acquireMaxTopicListInFlightPermitsAndWriteAndFlush(command);
}
```

**4. Proxy Reading Memory Control**

On the Pulsar Proxy side, the problem is slightly different. The problem occurs when the proxy receives a `CommandGetTopicsOfNamespace` command, forwards it to a broker, and receives a response. The proxy needs to deserialize and serialize the response before sending it to the client.
Memory is allocated for both deserialization and serialization.

Solving this requires a slight modification to PulsarDecoder.

In `PulsarDecoder.channelRead`, it would be necessary to record the size of the incoming message:

```java
        // Get a buffer that contains the full frame
        ByteBuf buffer = (ByteBuf) msg;
        try {
            // De-serialize the command
            int cmdSize = (int) buffer.readUnsignedInt();
            cmd.parseFrom(buffer, cmdSize);
```

It could be modified to store the `cmdSize` in a field instead of a local variable:
```java
    protected int cmdSize;
...
        // Get a buffer that contains the full frame
        ByteBuf buffer = (ByteBuf) msg;
        try {
            // De-serialize the command
            cmdSize = (int) buffer.readUnsignedInt();
            cmd.parseFrom(buffer, cmdSize);
```

Changes would be needed to be able to use this serialized size so that it doesn't need to be re-calculated.
`cmdSize` would be added as a field to `GetTopicsResult`:

```java
@Override
protected void handleGetTopicsOfNamespaceSuccess(CommandGetTopicsOfNamespaceResponse success) {
    checkArgument(state == State.Ready);

    long requestId = success.getRequestId();
    List<String> topics = success.getTopicsList();


    if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
        log.debug("{} Received get topics of namespace success response from server: {} - topics.size: {}",
                ctx.channel(), success.getRequestId(), topics.size());
    }

    CompletableFuture<GetTopicsResult> requestFuture =
            (CompletableFuture<GetTopicsResult>) pendingRequests.remove(requestId);
    if (requestFuture != null) {
        requestFuture.complete(new GetTopicsResult(topics,
                success.hasTopicsHash() ? success.getTopicsHash() : null,
                success.isFiltered(),
                success.isChanged(),
                // Store cmdSize in the GetTopicsResult <----
                cmdSize));
    } else {
        duplicatedResponseCounter.incrementAndGet();
        log.warn("{} Received unknown request id from server: {}", ctx.channel(), success.getRequestId());
    }
}
```

The limiter would be integrated into `LookupProxyHandler`'s `performGetTopicsOfNamespace` in this way:

```java
    proxyConnection.getConnectionPool().getConnection(addr).thenAccept(clientCnx -> {
        // Connected to backend broker
        long requestId = proxyConnection.newRequestId();
        ByteBuf command;
        command = Commands.newGetTopicsOfNamespaceRequest(namespaceName, requestId, mode,
                topicsPattern, topicsHash);
        // Acquire a fixed amount of permits initially since it's not known how much memory will be used
        // This will ensure that the operation continues only after it has the initial permits
        // It would be possible to use statistics for initial estimate, but this is simpler and sufficient
        maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.acquire(INITIAL_SIZE, AsyncDualMemoryLimiter.LimitType.HEAP_MEMORY)
            .thenCompose(initialPermit -> {
                clientCnx.newGetTopicsOfNamespace(command, requestId).whenComplete((r, t) -> {
                    if (t != null) {
                        maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.release(initialPermit);                            
                        log.warn("[{}] Failed to get TopicsOfNamespace {}: {}",
                                clientAddress, namespaceName, t.getMessage());
                        writeAndFlush(
                            Commands.newError(clientRequestId, getServerError(t), t.getMessage()));
                    } else {
                        // Update the initial permits to reflect the actual size of the response
                        maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.update(initialPermit, r.getSerializedSize())
                            .thenCompose(heapPermit -> {
                                // Acquire a direct memory permit for serialization
                                maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.acquire(r.getSerializedSize(), AsyncDualMemoryLimiter.LimitType.DIRECT_MEMORY)
                                    .thenAccept(directPermit -> {
                                        proxyConnection.ctx().writeAndFlush(
                                            Commands.newGetTopicsOfNamespaceResponse(r.getNonPartitionedOrPartitionTopics(),
                                                                                    r.getTopicsHash(), r.isFiltered(),
                                                                                    r.isChanged(), clientRequestId)
                                            ).addListener(future -> {
                                                // Release permits after the response has been written to the socket
                                                maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.release(heapPermit);
                                                maxTopicListInFlightLimiter.release(directPermit);
                                            });
                                    }) // Add exception handling for releasing directPermit
                            }); // Add exception handling for releasing heapPermit
                    }
                });
            });
        proxyConnection.getConnectionPool().releaseConnection(clientCnx);
    }).exceptionally(ex -> {
```

### Public-facing Changes

#### Configuration

**broker.conf**/**proxy.conf** additions to complete the memory management configuration set:

```properties
# Maximum heap memory for inflight topic list operations (MB)
# Default: 100 MB (supports ~1M topic names assuming 100 bytes each)
maxTopicListInFlightHeapMemSizeMB=100

# Maximum direct memory for inflight topic list responses (MB)  
# Default: 100 MB (network buffers for serialized responses)
maxTopicListInFlightDirectMemSizeMB=100

# Timeout for acquiring heap memory permits (milliseconds)
# Default: 25000 (25 seconds)
maxTopicListInFlightHeapMemSizePermitsAcquireTimeoutMillis=25000

# Maximum queue size for heap memory permit requests
# Default: 1000 (prevent unbounded queueing)
maxTopicListInFlightHeapMemSizePermitsAcquireQueueSize=1000

# Timeout for acquiring direct memory permits (milliseconds)
# Default: 25000 (25 seconds)  
maxTopicListInFlightDirectMemSizePermitsAcquireTimeoutMillis=25000

# Maximum queue size for direct memory permit requests
# Default: 1000 (prevent unbounded queueing)
maxTopicListInFlightDirectMemSizePermitsAcquireQueueSize=1000
```

#### Metrics

New metrics under `pulsar_broker_topic_list_`/`pulsar_proxy_topic_list` prefix, complementing existing memory metrics:

| Metric Name | Type | Description | Labels |
|------------|------|-------------|--------|
| `heap_memory_used_bytes` | Gauge | Current heap memory used by topic listings | `cluster` |
| `heap_memory_limit_bytes` | Gauge | Configured heap memory limit | `cluster` |
| `direct_memory_used_bytes` | Gauge | Current direct memory used by topic listings | `cluster` |
| `direct_memory_limit_bytes` | Gauge | Configured direct memory limit | `cluster` |
| `heap_queue_size` | Gauge | Current heap memory limiter queue size | `cluster` |
| `heap_queue_max_size` | Gauge | Maximum heap memory limiter queue size | `cluster` |
| `direct_queue_size` | Gauge | Current direct memory limiter queue size | `cluster` |
| `direct_queue_max_size` | Gauge | Maximum direct memory limiter queue size | `cluster` |
| `heap_wait_time_ms` | Histogram | Wait time for heap memory permits | `cluster` |
| `direct_wait_time_ms` | Histogram | Wait time for direct memory permits | `cluster` |
| `heap_timeout_total` | Counter | Total heap memory permit timeouts | `cluster` |
| `direct_timeout_total` | Counter | Total direct memory permit timeouts | `cluster` |

#### Public API

No changes to REST API.

#### Binary Protocol

No protocol changes. Existing commands continue to work with added server-side memory limits and backpressure.

## Monitoring

Operators should monitor the following metrics alongside existing memory management metrics and set up alerts:

1. **Memory Utilization Alert**:
   - Alert when `heap_memory_used_bytes / heap_memory_limit_bytes > 0.8`
   - Indicates the need to increase limits or investigate namespace growth

2. **Queue Saturation Alert**:
   - Alert when `heap_queue_size / heap_queue_max_size > 0.9`
   - Indicates sustained memory pressure requiring capacity adjustment

3. **Timeout Rate Alert**:
   - Alert when `rate(heap_timeout_total[5m]) > 1`
   - Indicates clients experiencing failures due to memory-based flow control

4. **P99 Wait Time Alert**:
   - Alert when `heap_wait_time_ms{quantile="0.99"} > 10000`
   - Indicates degraded client experience due to memory pressure

These alerts should be configured alongside existing memory alerts for `managedLedgerCacheSizeMB`, `maxMessagePublishBufferSizeInMB`, and other memory limits to provide comprehensive memory management visibility.

## Security Considerations

The memory limiting mechanism introduces new denial-of-service protections:

1. **Resource Exhaustion Protection**: The limits prevent bad clients from triggering OOM by requesting large topic lists repeatedly, completing the broker's defense against memory-based attacks.

2. **Fair Queueing**: The queue size limits prevent bad clients from monopolizing memory permits and blocking legitimate requests.

3. **Multi-tenancy Isolation**: Consider per-tenant memory limits in future iterations to prevent one tenant from consuming all available topic listing memory permits, similar to how other memory limits could benefit from tenant isolation.

## Backward & Forward Compatibility

### Upgrade

1. The feature can be disabled setting the limits set to 0 initially to maintain full compatibility
2. After upgrade, gradually enable memory limits:
   ```bash
   # Start with high limits to understand current usage
   pulsar-admin brokers update-dynamic-config --config maxTopicListInFlightHeapMemSizeMB --value 512
   pulsar-admin brokers update-dynamic-config --config maxTopicListInFlightDirectMemSizeMB --value 512
   
   # Monitor metrics and adjust downward based on actual usage patterns
   pulsar-admin brokers update-dynamic-config --config maxTopicListInFlightHeapMemSizeMB --value 200
   pulsar-admin brokers update-dynamic-config --config maxTopicListInFlightDirectMemSizeMB --value 200
   pulsar-admin brokers update-dynamic-config --config maxTopicListInFlightHeapMemSizeMB --value 100
   pulsar-admin brokers update-dynamic-config --config maxTopicListInFlightDirectMemSizeMB --value 100
   ```
3. No client changes are required

### Downgrade / Rollback

- No changes required

### Pulsar Geo-Replication Upgrade & Downgrade/Rollback Considerations

- No impact on replication protocol

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Pagination Protocol
- **Approach**: Modify protocol to support paginated topic listing
- **Rejected because**: Requires breaking protocol changes and client updates

### Alternative 2: Response Streaming
- **Approach**: Stream topics as they're retrieved rather than buffering
- **Rejected because**: Streaming in smaller "chunks" doesn't solve the memory issue since the Pulsar client could have multiple outstanding requests. The topic list watcher is already designed to handle this scenario to reduce the load on the broker.

### Alternative 3: Hard Memory Limits with Immediate Failure
- **Approach**: Fail requests immediately when memory threshold reached
- **Rejected because**: Client retries would add more load and wouldn't provide graceful degradation under peak load

### Alternative 4: Extend Existing Memory Limits
- **Approach**: Include topic listing memory in `managedLedgerCacheSizeMB` or similar
- **Rejected because**: Topic listing memory has different characteristics and usage patterns, requiring separate tuning and monitoring

## General Notes

- Memory estimates are conservative and may overestimate actual usage to ensure safety
- The solution prioritizes memory management consistency and stability over perfect memory accuracy
- This completes Pulsar's comprehensive memory management framework by addressing the final unbounded allocation path
