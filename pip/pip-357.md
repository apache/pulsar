# PIP-357: Correct the conf name in load balance module.

# Background knowledge

We use `loadBalancerBandwithInResourceWeight` and `loadBalancerBandwithOutResourceWeight` to calculate the broker's load in the load balance module. However, the correct conf name should be `loadBalancerBandwidthInResourceWeight` and `loadBalancerBandwidthOutResourceWeight`. This PIP is to correct the conf name in the load balance module.

# Motivation

The current conf name is incorrect.


# Detailed Design

Rename `loadBalancerBandwithInResourceWeight` to `loadBalancerBandwidthInResourceWeight` and `loadBalancerBandwithOutResourceWeight` to `loadBalancerBandwidthOutResourceWeight` in the load balance module.

In case of users upgrading to this version don't notice the change, we will still support the old conf name in following way:
- If a configuration is not the default configuration, use that configuration.
- If both the new and the old are configured different from the default value, use the new one.

# Backward & Forward Compatibility

Partial backward compatible, users upgrading to this version have better update the conf name in the configuration file.
