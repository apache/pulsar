# PIP-423: Add a new admin API to acknowledge a single message

# Background knowledge

*   **Message Identification (MessageId):** In Pulsar, every message is uniquely identified by its `MessageId`, which encapsulates a `ledgerId`, an `entryId`, and optionally a partition index. The combination of `ledgerId` and `entryId` (often represented as a `Position`) uniquely identifies a message's physical storage location within a topic. A producer receives a `MessageId` for each message it successfully sends.
*   **Subscriptions and Cursors:** Each subscription on a topic maintains its own "cursor" which tracks consumption progress. For subscription types like `Shared` or `Key_Shared`, the cursor can track individually acknowledged messages, even if they are out of order relative to the main consumption progress marker (`mark-delete position`). The cursor is responsible for ensuring that acknowledged messages are not redelivered.
*   **Individual Acknowledgement:** Pulsar subscriptions support different acknowledgement modes. `Shared` and `Key_Shared` subscriptions heavily rely on **individual acknowledgement**. This allows a consumer to acknowledge a single message. When a message is acknowledged individually ahead of the `mark-delete position`, the broker's `ManagedCursor` persistently tracks this to ensure that acknowledged messages are not redelivered after a broker or consumer restart. This proposal leverages this existing, robust mechanism.
*   **Delayed Messages:** Pulsar supports scheduling messages for future delivery. A primary use case for this proposal is to allow a scheduled message to be effectively "cancelled" by acknowledging it before its delivery time. Since the message is marked as consumed by the cursor, the `DelayedDeliveryTracker` will not dispatch it.
*   **Existing `skip` API:** Pulsar has an admin API to `skip` a specified *number* of messages for a subscription. This is useful for bulk-skipping but lacks the precision to target a single, specific message within a large backlog, especially if its exact sequence is unknown. This proposal provides a more precise way to skip messages by their specific `MessageId`.

# Motivation

Operators and SREs occasionally need to intervene in a topic's backlog to handle problematic messages or adapt to changing business requirements. For instance:

*   **Cancelling Scheduled Actions:** A delayed message representing a future task (e.g., a scheduled report or a notification) may become obsolete. The most efficient way to handle this is to prevent its delivery entirely by acknowledging it pre-emptively.
*   **Removing Backlogs:** A specific message in a backlog might have a malformed payload that causes consumer applications to crash repeatedly. Removing this single "poison pill" message without affecting valid messages around it is a critical operational capability.
*   **Manual Business Logic Correction:** An event may have been sent that is later determined to be invalid due to external factors. An administrator needs a precise tool to remove this specific event from a subscription's delivery queue.

The existing `skip(numMessages)` API is a blunt instrument, ill-suited for these precise, targeted operations. This proposal introduces an administrative API to skip messages by their specific `MessageId`, providing a robust and reliable way to remove any individual message—delayed or not—from a subscription's backlog.

# Goals

## In Scope

*   Introduce a new Admin API endpoint and a corresponding `pulsar-admin` CLI command to support skipping specific messages for a subscription.
*   The target message(s) will be identified by their `ledgerId` and `entryId`.
*   The implementation will leverage Pulsar's existing, robust `AckType.Individual` mechanism for persistence and reliability.
*   This feature will only be supported for subscription types that allow individual acknowledgements (e.g., `Shared`, `Key_Shared`).
*   Ensure that once a message is successfully skipped via this API, it will not be delivered to any consumer on the targeted subscription.
*   Support for both partitioned and non-partitioned topics.

## Out of Scope

*   Modifying the existing `skip/{numMessages}` endpoint. A new, dedicated endpoint will be created for clarity.
*   Automatic skipping of messages across geo-replicated clusters. The command is a per-cluster administrative operation that must be run on each cluster where the skip is needed.

# High Level Design

The proposed solution introduces a new admin API that triggers Pulsar's individual acknowledgement capability on demand for specific messages.

1.  **Initiate Skip-by-ID:** An administrator initiates the action via the new `pulsar-admin topics skip-messages` command or its corresponding REST API call. The request must specify the topic, the target subscription, and a list of message IDs (`ledgerId:entryId`) to be skipped.

2.  **Broker Receives Request:** The Pulsar broker receives the admin request for the new endpoint `.../subscription/{subName}/skipByMessageIds`. It validates the administrator's permissions for the topic, re-using the existing `TopicOperation.SKIP` authorization rule.

3.  **Delegate to Subscription:** The broker, after validating topic ownership and permissions, invokes a new method `skipMessages(Map<String, String> messageIds)` on the target `PersistentSubscription` object. For partitioned topics, the request is scattered to all partitions, and each partition broker performs this action.

4.  **Perform Individual Acknowledgement:** Inside the `PersistentSubscription`, the following occurs:
    *   It verifies that the subscription's type supports individual acknowledgements.
    *   It constructs `Position` objects from the provided ledger and entry IDs.
    *   It calls its internal `acknowledgeMessage()` method with `AckType.Individual` for the specified positions. This is functionally identical to what would happen if a consumer individually acknowledged the message.

5.  **Persistence and Effect:** The `ManagedCursor` for the subscription records these individual acknowledgements, which are persisted to metadata storage.
    *   For a **regular message** in the backlog, it is marked as consumed for that subscription and will not be delivered.
    *   For a **delayed message**, it is marked as consumed before the `DelayedDeliveryTracker` attempts to schedule it. The message is thus effectively **cancelled**.

This design is simple and robust as it builds upon the broker's proven message acknowledgement foundation while providing a clean, dedicated administrative API for this precise operational task.

# Detailed Design

## Design & Implementation Details

The core of the implementation involves adding a new method to the `Subscription` interface and implementing it in `PersistentSubscription` to leverage the existing individual acknowledgment mechanism.

1.  **Subscription Interface Extension:**
    The `Subscription` interface is extended with a new method to handle skipping by message IDs.

```java
// in pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/Subscription.java
public interface Subscription extends MessageExpirer {
    // ... existing methods
    CompletableFuture<Void> skipMessages(int numMessagesToSkip);

    CompletableFuture<Void> skipMessages(Map<String, String> messageIds);
    // ... existing methods
}
```

2.  **PersistentSubscription Implementation:**

The `PersistentSubscription` class provides the concrete implementation. It converts the message ID map into `Position` objects and uses the standard individual acknowledge flow.

```java
// in pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentSubscription.java
@Override
public CompletableFuture<Void> skipMessages(Map<String, String> messageIds) {
    if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {
        log.debug("[{}][{}] Skipping messages by messageIds, current backlog {}", topicName, subName,
                cursor.getNumberOfEntriesInBacklog(false));
    }

    if (Subscription.isCumulativeAckMode(getType())) {
        return CompletableFuture.failedFuture(new NotAllowedException("Unsupported subscription type."));
    }

    List<Position> positions = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : messageIds.entrySet()) {
        try {
            long ledgerId = Long.parseLong(entry.getKey());
            long entryId = Long.parseLong(entry.getValue());
            Position position = PositionFactory.create(ledgerId, entryId);
            positions.add(position);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return CompletableFuture.failedFuture(new NotAllowedException("Invalid message ID."));
        }
    }

    Map<String, Long> properties = Collections.emptyMap();
    acknowledgeMessage(positions, AckType.Individual, properties);

    return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
}
```

3.  **Admin API Logic:**

The `PersistentTopicsBase` class is updated with a new `internalSkipByMessageIds` method which handles the request and calls the `subscription.skipMessages(Map)` method. It also includes logic to handle partitioned topics by fanning out the request to each partition owner.
```java
// in pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/admin/impl/PersistentTopicsBase.java
protected void internalSkipByMessageIds(AsyncResponse asyncResponse, String subName, boolean authoritative,
                                        Map<String, String> messageIds) {
    // ... validate operation and ownership ...

    // Logic for a single partition / non-partitioned topic
    // ...
    Subscription sub = topic.getSubscription(subName);
    if (sub == null) {
        return FutureUtil.failedFuture(new RestException(Status.NOT_FOUND,
                getSubNotFoundErrorMessage(topic.getName(), subName)));
    }
    return sub.skipMessages(messageIds);
    // ...
}
```

## Public-facing Changes
The existing `skipMessages` API is modified to accept a POST body containing message IDs.

### Public API

A new REST endpoint is added for skipping specific messages.

*   **Path (v2):** `POST /admin/v2/persistent/{tenant}/{namespace}/{topic}/subscription/{subName}/skipByMessageIds`
*   **Path (v1):** `POST /admin/v1/persistent/{property}/{cluster}/{namespace}/{topic}/subscription/{subName}/skipByMessageIds`
*   **Path Parameters:**
    *   All path parameters identify the target subscription.
*   **HTTP Body Parameters (JSON):** A map where keys are `ledgerId` as a string and values are `entryId` as a string.
    *   **Example Body:** `{"12345": "100", "12346": "200"}`
*   **Response Codes:**
    *   `204 No Content`: The operation was successful.
    *   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid message ID format in the request body (e.g., non-numeric ledgerId or entryId).
    *   `403 Forbidden`: The client is not authorized to perform a `SKIP` operation on this topic.
    *   `404 Not Found`: The topic or subscription does not exist.
    *   `405 Method Not Allowed`: The subscription type does not support individual acknowledgement (e.g., `Exclusive`, `Failover`).
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred in the broker.

### Binary protocol

No changes are made to the Pulsar binary protocol.

### Configuration

**No new configuration parameters are introduced. However, this feature's performance and behavior under heavy load are directly influenced by existing `ManagedLedger` configurations that govern the persistence of acknowledgement holes.** 

**Administrators should be aware of these settings if they expect a high volume of message cancellations:**

```
# Max number of "acknowledgment holes" that are going to be persistently stored.
# When acknowledging out of order, a consumer will leave holes that are supposed
# to be quickly filled by acking all the messages. The information of which
# messages are acknowledged is persisted by compressing in "ranges" of messages
# that were acknowledged. After the max number of ranges is reached, the information
# will only be tracked in memory and messages will be redelivered in case of
# crashes.
managedLedgerMaxUnackedRangesToPersist=10000

# Maximum number of partially acknowledged batch messages per subscription that will have their batch
# deleted indexes persisted. Batch deleted index state is handled when acknowledgmentAtBatchIndexLevelEnabled=true.
# When this limit is exceeded, remaining batch message containing the batch deleted indexes will
# only be tracked in memory. In case of broker restarts or load balancing events, the batch
# deleted indexes will be cleared while redelivering the messages to consumers.
managedLedgerMaxBatchDeletedIndexToPersist=10000

# When storing acknowledgement state, choose a more compact serialization format that stores
# individual acknowledgements as a bitmap which is serialized to an array of long values. NOTE: This setting requires
# managedLedgerUnackedRangesOpenCacheSetEnabled=true to be effective.
managedLedgerPersistIndividualAckAsLongArray=true

# When set to true, a BitSet will be used to track acknowledged messages that come after the "mark delete position"
# for each subscription. RoaringBitmap is used as a memory efficient BitSet implementation for the acknowledged
# messages tracking. Unacknowledged ranges are the message ranges excluding the acknowledged messages.
managedLedgerUnackedRangesOpenCacheSetEnabled=true

# Max number of "acknowledgment holes" that can be stored in MetadataStore. If number of unack message range is higher
# than this limit then broker will persist unacked ranges into bookkeeper to avoid additional data overhead into
# MetadataStore.
managedLedgerMaxUnackedRangesToPersistInMetadataStore=1000

# ManagedCursorInfo compression type, option values (NONE, LZ4, ZLIB, ZSTD, SNAPPY).
# If value is NONE, then save the ManagedCursorInfo bytes data directly without compression.
# Using compression reduces the size of persistent cursor (subscription) metadata. This enables using a higher
# managedLedgerMaxUnackedRangesToPersistInMetadataStore value and reduces the overall metadata stored in
# the metadata store such as ZooKeeper.
managedCursorInfoCompressionType=NONE

# ManagedCursorInfo compression size threshold (bytes), only compress metadata when origin size more then this value.
# 0 means compression will always apply.
managedCursorInfoCompressionThresholdInBytes=16384

# ManagedLedgerInfo compression type, option values (NONE, LZ4, ZLIB, ZSTD, SNAPPY).
# If value is invalid or NONE, then save the ManagedLedgerInfo bytes data directly without compression.
# Using compression reduces the size of the persistent topic metadata. When a topic contains a large number of
# individual ledgers in BookKeeper or tiered storage, compression helps prevent the metadata size from exceeding
# the maximum size of a metadata store entry (ZNode in ZooKeeper). This also reduces the overall metadata stored
# in the metadata store such as ZooKeeper.
managedLedgerInfoCompressionType=NONE

# ManagedLedgerInfo compression size threshold (bytes), only compress metadata when origin size more then this value.
# 0 means compression will always apply.
managedLedgerInfoCompressionThresholdInBytes=16384
```

### CLI

A new CLI command is added to `pulsar-admin topics`.

*   **Command:** `skip-messages`
*   **Description:** Skip some messages for a subscription by their message IDs.
*   **Usage:** `pulsar-admin topics skip-messages <topic-name> [options]`
*   **Options:**
    *   `-s, --subscription <subName>` (required): The subscription to skip messages on.
    *   `-m, --messageId <ledgerId=entryId>` (required): The message ID to skip. This option can be specified multiple times.
*   **Example:**
```bash
# Skip a single message for subscription 'my-sub'
pulsar-admin topics skip-messages persistent://public/default/my-topic \
  -s my-sub -m 12345=100

# Skip multiple messages
pulsar-admin topics skip-messages persistent://public/default/my-topic \
  -s my-sub -m 12345=100 -m 12345=101
```

# Backward & Forward Compatibility

## Pulsar Geo-Replication Upgrade & Downgrade/Rollback Considerations

This operation is local to a cluster and a subscription's cursor. To acknowledge a message on a replicated topic in multiple clusters, the admin command must be executed against each cluster. Geo-replication state is not affected.
