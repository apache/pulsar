# PIP-363: Introduce a new load balance algorithm AvgShedder

# Background knowledge

Pulsar has two load balance interfaces:
- `LoadSheddingStrategy` is an unloading strategy that identifies high load brokers and unloads some of the bundles they carry to reduce the load.
- `ModularLoadManagerStrategy` is a placement strategy responsible for assigning bundles to brokers.

## LoadSheddingStrategy
There are three available algorithms: `ThresholdShedder`, `OverloadShedder`, `UniformLoadShedder`.

### ThresholdShedder
`ThresholdShedder` uses the following method to calculate the maximum resource utilization rate for each broker,
which includes CPU, direct memory, bandwidth in, and bandwidth out.
```
    public double getMaxResourceUsageWithWeight(final double cpuWeight,
                                                final double directMemoryWeight, final double bandwidthInWeight,
                                                final double bandwidthOutWeight) {
        return max(cpu.percentUsage() * cpuWeight,
                directMemory.percentUsage() * directMemoryWeight, bandwidthIn.percentUsage() * bandwidthInWeight,
                bandwidthOut.percentUsage() * bandwidthOutWeight) / 100;
    }
```

After calculating the maximum resource utilization rate for each broker, a historical weight algorithm will
also be executed to obtain the final score.
```
historyUsage = historyUsage == null ? resourceUsage : historyUsage * historyPercentage + (1 - historyPercentage) * resourceUsage;
```
The historyPercentage is determined by configuring the `loadBalancerHistoryResourcePercentage`. 
The default value is 0.9, which means that the last calculated score accounts for 90%, 
while the current calculated score only accounts for 10%.

The introduction of this historical weight algorithm is to avoid bundle switching caused by
short-term abnormal load increase or decrease, but in fact, this algorithm will introduce some
serious problems, which will be explained in detail later.

Next, calculate the average score of all brokers in the entire cluster: `avgUsage=totalUsage/totalBrokers`. 
When the score of any broker exceeds a certain threshold of avgUsage, it is determined that the broker is overloaded.
The threshold is determined by the configuration `loadBalancerBrokerThresholdShedderPercentage`, with a default value of 10.


### OverloadShedder
`OverloadShedder` use the same method `getMaxResourceUsageWithWeight` to calculate the maximum resource utilization rate for each broker.
The difference is that `OverloadShedder` will not use the historical weight algorithm to calculate the final score, 
the final score is the current maximum resource utilization rate of the broker.

After obtaining the load score for each broker, compare it with the `loadBalancerBrokerOverloadedThresholdPercentage`. 
If the threshold is exceeded, it is considered overloaded, with a default value of 85%.

This algorithm is relatively simple, but there are many serious corner cases, so it is not recommended to use `OverloadShedder`.
Here are two cases:
- When the load on each broker in the cluster reaches the threshold, the bundle unload will continue to be executed,
   but it will only switch from one overloaded broker to another, which is meaningless.
- If there are no broker whose load reaches the threshold, adding new brokers will not balance the traffic to the new added brokers.
The impact of these two points is quite serious, so we won't talk about it next.


### UniformLoadShedder
`UniformLoadShedder` will first calculate the maximum and minimum message rates, as well as the maximum and minimum 
traffic throughput and corresponding broker. Then calculate the maximum and minimum difference, with two thresholds 
corresponding to message rate and throughput size, respectively.

- loadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold

The message rate percentage threshold between the highest and lowest loaded brokers, with a default value of 50,
can trigger bundle unload when the maximum message rate is 1.5 times the minimum message rate. 
For example, broker 1 with 50K msgRate and broker 2 with 30K msgRate will have a (50-30)/30=66%>50% difference in msgRate,
and the load balancer can unload the bundle from broker 1 to broker 2.

- loadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold

The threshold for the message throughput multiplier between the highest and lowest loaded brokers, 
with a default value of 4, can trigger bundle unload when the maximum throughput is 4 times the minimum throughput.
For example, if the msgRate of broker 1 is 450MB, broker 2 is 100MB, and the difference in msgThrough 
is 450/100=4.5>4 times, then the load balancer can unload the bundle from broker 1 to broker 2.


After introducing the algorithm of `UniformLoadShedder`, we can clearly obtain the following information:
- `UniformLoadShedder` does not have the logic to handle load jitter. For example,
when the traffic suddenly increases or decreases. This load data point is adopted, triggering a bundle unload.
However, the traffic of this topic will soon return to normal, so it is very likely to trigger a bundle unload again.
This type of bundle unload should be avoided. This kind of scenario is very common, actually.

- `UniformLoadShedder` does not rely on indicators such as CPU usage and network card usage to determine high load
and low load brokers, but rather determines them based on message rate and traffic throughput size,
while `ThresholdShedder` and `OverloadShedder` rely on machine resource indicators such as CPU usage to determine.
If the cluster is heterogeneous, such as different machines with different hardware configurations, 
or if there are other processes sharing resources on the machine where the broker is located, 
`UniformLoadShedder` is likely to misjudge high and low load brokers, thereby migrating the load from high-performance 
but low load brokers to low-performance but high load brokers. 
Therefore, it is not recommended for users to use `UniformLoadShedder` in heterogeneous environments.

- `UniformLoadShedder` will only unload the bundle from one of the highest loaded brokers at a time,
which may take a considerable amount of time for a large cluster to complete all load balancing tasks.
For example, if there are 100 high load brokers in the current cluster and 100 new machines to be added,
it is roughly estimated that it will take 100 shedding to complete the balancing.
However, since the execution time interval of the `LoadSheddingStrategy` policy is determined by the 
configuration of `loadBalancerSheddingIntervalMinutes`, which defaults to once every 1 minute, 
so it will take 100 minutes to complete all tasks. For users using large partition topics, their tasks 
are likely to be disconnected multiple times within this 100 minutes, which greatly affects the user experience.

# Security Considerations
<!--
A detailed description of the security details that ought to be considered for the PIP. This is most relevant for any new HTTP endpoints, new Pulsar Protocol Commands, and new security features. The goal is to describe details like which role will have permission to perform an action.

An important aspect to consider is also multi-tenancy: Does the feature I'm adding have the permissions / roles set in such a way that prevent one tenant accessing another tenant's data/configuration? For example, the Admin API to read a specific message for a topic only allows a client to read messages for the target topic. However, that was not always the case. CVE-2021-41571 (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/CVE-2021-41571) resulted because the API was incorrectly written and did not properly prevent a client from reading another topic's messages even though authorization was in place. The problem was missing input validation that verified the requested message was actually a message for that topic. The fix to CVE-2021-41571 was input validation. 

If there is uncertainty for this section, please submit the PIP and request for feedback on the mailing list.
