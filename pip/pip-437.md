# PIP-437: Granular and Fixed-Delay Policies for Message Delivery

# Background
Pulsar's delayed delivery feature allows producers to schedule messages to be delivered at a future time. To provide administrative control and prevent abuse, **PIP-315** introduced a `maxDeliveryDelayInMillis` policy.
While this provides an important safeguard by setting an *upper bound*, it does not address all administrative needs. There is currently no way to enforce a *specific, non-overridable* delay for all messages on a topic.

# Motivation

### The Limitation:
Pulsar's delayed message delivery relies on tracking individual messages until their delivery time. This tracking state is persisted as part of the subscription's cursor metadata,
which records gaps or "holes" for unacknowledged messages. The Pulsar Managed Ledger has a hard limit on the number of disjoint unacknowledged ranges it can persist for a cursor, 
configured by `managedLedgerMaxUnackedRangesToPersist` (defaulting to 10,000).
A large volume of messages with widely varying delivery times can easily exhaust this capacity with each delayed message creating a separate unacknowledged hole. 

### The Impact: Upon restart, the broker's only source of truth is the last persisted cursor position.
Once the `managedLedgerMaxUnackedRangesToPersist` limit is breached, the broker stops persisting the cursor's state and maintains it only in memory. This in-memory state is volatile and is completely lost if the broker restarts for any reason.
Upon restart, the broker's only source of truth is the last successfully persisted cursor position. This position does not account for the lost tracking information, forcing the broker to re-dispatch all messages that were being tracked in memory.
This results in significant and difficult-to-predict message duplication for downstream consumers.

The lack of administrative controls on message delivery delays introduces critical risks to cluster stability and data integrity.
This proposal aims to provide granular control at the topic and namespace levels to add a new fixed delay delivery configuration: 

1. **Prevent Message Duplication:**  By forcing all messages on a topic to have the exact same delay,it prevents the delayed message tracker from becoming overwhelmed and eliminates the risk of message duplication upon broker restart, leading to a more stable and predictable system.
2. **Enable High-Scale Scheduling:** When all messages in a topic have the same delay, the broker has significantly less state to manage. This allows topics to be used as highly efficient, high-scale schedulers. This pattern works exceptionally well with the `InMemoryDelayedDeliveryTracker` and its `delayedDeliveryFixedDelayDetectionLookahead` feature (introduced in #16609, #17907), as the broker can avoid building a large, complex index of individual delayed messages.
3. **Enforcing Compliance and Business Rules:** Certain workflows may require certain control that require the enforcement at the broker level
4. **Simplifying Producer Configuration:** By setting a fixed delay on the topic, the responsibility for managing the delay logic is shifted from the client to the broker, reducing the risk of client-side misconfiguration.

# Goals
## In Scope
-   Introduce a new `fixed-delivery-delay` policy, configurable at the namespace and topic levels, to enforce a mandatory delivery delay.
-   Enhance the existing `/delayedDelivery` admin API endpoints and `pulsar-admin` commands to manage both the existing `maxDeliveryDelayInMillis` and the new `fixedDeliveryDelayInMillis` policies within the same policy group.
-   Ensure the `fixed-delivery-delay` policy takes precedence over any client-specified delay and the existing `max-delivery-delay` policy.

# High Level Design
This proposal will enhance the existing `DelayedDeliveryPolicies` object to include a new `fixedDeliveryDelayInMillis` field.
This new policy will follow Pulsar's standard hierarchical model, allowing it to be set at the namespace level and overridden at the topic level.
The core logic will be implemented with the following precedence:

1.  **If `fixed-delivery-delay` is set:** The broker will ignore any `deliverAt` time sent by the producer and will override it by calculating `publish_time + fixed_delay`. The `max-delivery-delay` policy is ignored.
2.  **If `fixed-delivery-delay` is NOT set, but `max-delivery-delay` is:** The broker will validate the producer's requested `deliverAt` time against the `max-delivery-delay` policy, rejecting the message if it exceeds the limit.
3.  **If neither policy is set:** The system behaves as it does today, honoring the client's requested `deliverAt` time, constrained only by the global broker-level setting.

# Detailed Design
## Design & Implementation Details

1.  **Data Model Changes**:
    *   Add a new `fixedDeliveryDelayInMillis` field to the `DelayedDeliveryPolicies.java` class. This class is already used for the existing `maxDeliveryDelayInMillis` policy.
    *   Update `HierarchyTopicPolicies.java` to resolve the effective `fixedDeliveryDelayInMillis` for a topic, respecting the topic-over-namespace hierarchy.

2.  **Enforcement Logic**:
    *   The enforcement logic will be placed in `PersistentTopic.java` within the `publishMessage` and `publishTxnMessage` methods, right before the existing `isExceedMaximumDeliveryDelay` check.
    *   This logic will modify the `MessageMetadata` of the incoming message *before* it is passed to the managed ledger for persistence.

### Binary protocol

### Configuration

### CLI
*   The existing `set-delayed-delivery` command in `CmdTopicPolicies.java` and `CmdNamespaces.java` will be updated with a new optional parameter: `--fixed-delay` (or `-fd`).
*   The REST endpoints under `/delayedDelivery` will be updated to accept and return the new `fixedDeliveryDelayInMillis` field in their JSON payload.

### Metrics

To provide visibility into the enforcement of the new message delay policies,we will introduce a new counter metric for maxDeliveryDelayInMillis 
*   **Full Name**: `pulsar.broker.topic.messages.delayed.rejected`
*   **Description**: A counter for the total number of messages rejected because their delivery delay exceeded the configured maximum (`max-delivery-delay`). This helps administrators monitor when the policy is being enforced and identify misconfigured producers.
*   **Attributes (Labels)**:
    *   `pulsar.cluster`: The cluster where the broker is running.
    *   `pulsar.namespace`: The namespace of the topic.
    *   `pulsar.topic`: The specific topic where the message was rejected.
*   **Unit**: `{message}` (A standard unit for a count of messages).

To provide visibility into the enforcement of the fix message delay policies, a new counter metric will be introduced for fixedDeliveryDelayInMillis
* **Full Name**: `pulsar.broker.topic.messages.fixed.delay.overridden`
    *   **Description**: A counter for the total number of messages where a client-specified `deliverAt` time was overridden by the topic's `fixed-delivery-delay` policy. This provides direct observability into how often the policy is being enforced against client-side settings.
    *   **Attributes (Labels)**:
        *   `pulsar.cluster`: The cluster where the broker is running.
        *   `pulsar.namespace`: The namespace of the topic.
        *   `pulsar.topic`: The specific topic where the message was overridden.
    *   **Unit**: `{message}`.

# Monitoring
Administrators can use the new `pulsar.broker.topic.messages.delayed.rejected` metric to monitor the health and usage of the delayed delivery feature.
A sudden spike in this metric could indicate:
1.  A producer application has been deployed with a misconfiguration, attempting to schedule messages with an overly long delay.
2.  A recent change to the `max-delivery-delay` policy at the namespace or topic level is now affecting existing producers.

A high or unexpected count for `pulsar.broker.topic.messages.fixed.delay.overridden` indicates that producer applications are sending messages with a `deliverAt` time to a topic that has a `fixed-delivery-delay` policy. 
While the policy is being enforced correctly, this metric helps operators identify clients that may be misconfigured or unaware of the topic's enforced behavior.

# Security Considerations

# Backward & Forward Compatibility

## Upgrade

<!--
Specify the list of instructions, if there are such, needed to perform before/after upgrading to Pulsar version containing this feature.
-->

## Downgrade / Rollback
Downgrading to a version without this feature is supported, but the new `fixed-delivery-delay` policy will no longer be enforced.
-   **Behavior Change**:  It will revert to the previous behavior of either honoring the client's `deliverAt` time or enforcing the `max-delivery-delay` policy.
-   **Clean Rollback**: Disable the `fixed-delivery-delay` policy on all relevant topics and namespaces *before* starting the rollback process. This can be done by setting the fixed delay value to `0` using the `pulsar-admin ... set-delayed-delivery` command.

## Pulsar Geo-Replication Upgrade & Downgrade/Rollback Considerations
The system shall guarantee that changes to delayed delivery policies are applied atomically across all active brokers.
This ensures that the cluster does not operate in a mixed-policy state during either an upgrade or a downgrade procedure.
During a geo-replication upgrade, ensure that all clusters are upgraded before relying on the consistency of the new
delayed delivery policies.
If downgrading a geo-replicated cluster, remove the new topic-level configurations *before* downgrading to prevent
inconsistencies between clusters.
