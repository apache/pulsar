# PIP-326: Create a BOM to ease dependency management

# Background knowledge

A `Bill of Materials` (BOM) is a special kind of POM that is used to control the versions of a projectâ€™s dependencies and provide a central place to define and update those versions.
A BOM dependency ensure that all dependencies (both direct and transitive) are at the same version specified in the BOM.

To illustrate, consider the [Spring Data BOM](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-bom/blob/main/bom/pom.xml) which declares the version for each of the published Spring Data modules.
Without a BOM, consuming applications must specify the version on each of the imported Spring Data module dependencies.
However, when using a BOM the version numbers can be omitted.

# Motivation

The BOM provides the following benefits for consuming applications:
1. Reduce burden by not having to specify the version in multiple locations
2. Reduce chance of version mismatch (and therefore errors)

The **burden** and **chance** of version mismatch is **directly** proportional to the number of modules published by a project.
Pulsar publishes **many (29)** modules and therefore consuming applications are likely to run into the above issues.

A concrete example of the above symptoms can be found in the [Spring Boot BOM](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/92a4a1194d7a599cb57b5e5169ee5bbbfce637d8/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-dependencies/build.gradle#L1140-L1215) which provides a section for the list of Pulsar module dependencies as follows:

```groovy
library("Pulsar", "3.1.1") {
    group("org.apache.pulsar") {
        modules = [
            "bouncy-castle-bc",

            "pulsar-client-1x-base",

            "pulsar-websocket"
        ]
    }
}
```
The problem with this hardcoded approach is that the Spring Boot team is not the expert of Pulsar and this list of modules could become stale and/or invalid rather easily.
A better suitor for this specification is the Pulsar team, the subject-matter-experts who know exactly what is going on with Pulsar (which modules are available and what those version(s) should be).

If there were a Pulsar BOM, the above Spring Boot dependency section would shrink down to the following:
```groovy
library("Pulsar", "3.1.1") {
    group("org.apache.pulsar") {
        imports = [
            "pulsar-bom"
        ]
    }
}
```

It is worth noting that This is an industry best practice and more often than not, a library provides a BOM. A handful of examples can be found in the "Links" section at the bottom of this document.

# Goals
Provide a Pulsar BOM in order to solve the issues listed in the motivation section.

## In Scope
The intention is to create a single BOM for all published Pulsar modules.
The benefit goes to consumers of the project (our users) as described in the motivation.

## Out of Scope
This proposal is not attempting to create various BOMs that are tailored to specific usecases.


# High Level Design
1. From a build target, generate a list of published Pulsar modules
2. From the list of modules, generate a BOM Maven POM file
3. Publish the BOM artifact as any other Pulsar module is published

# Detailed Design

Leaving the detailed design out of the PIP for now. 
There is a working prototype and more details will be revealed when and if the PIP is approved.

## Public-facing Changes
NA (new addition)


### Public API
The only public "API" is the newly published POM artifact.

### Binary protocol
NA

### Configuration
NA

### CLI
NA

### Metrics
NA

# Monitoring

## Revert
1. Deprecate the POM module in version `m.n.p`.
2. Stop producing subsequent POM modules in version `m.n+1.0`

## Upgrade
NA

# Alternatives
Continue on as-is, not publishing a BOM.
