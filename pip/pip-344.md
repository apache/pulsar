# PIP-344: Correct the behavior of the public API pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic(topicName)

# Background knowledge

### Topic auto-creation.
- The partitioned topic auto-creation is dependent on `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`
    - It triggers partitioned metadata creation by `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`
    - And triggers the topic partition creation by producers' registration and consumers' registration.
- When calling `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic(topicName)`, Pulsar will automatically create the partitioned topic metadata if it does not exist, either using `HttpLookupService` or `BinaryProtoLookupService`.

### Now `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`'s behavior.
| case | broker allow `auto-create` | param allow <br> `create if not exists` | non-partitioned topic | partitioned topic |  current behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `true/false` | `true/false` | `exists: true` | | REST API: `partitions: 0`<br> Client API: `partitions: 0` |
| 2 | `true/false` | `true/false` | | `exists: true` <br> `partitions: 3` | REST API: `partitions: 3`<br> Client API: `partitions: 3` |
| 3 | `true` | `true` | | | REST API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: true` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 3` <br> Client API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: true` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 3` <br> |
| 4 | `true` | `false` | | | REST API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: false` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 0` <br> Client API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;not support <br> |
| 5 | `false` | `true` | | | REST API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: false` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 0` <br> Client API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: false` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 0` <br> |

# Motivation

The param `create if not exists` of the Client API is always `true.`

- For case 4 of `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`'s behavior, it always tries to create the partitioned metadata, but the API name is `getxxx`.
- For case 5 of `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`'s behavior, it returns a `0` partitioned metadata, but the topic does not exist. For the correct behavior of this case, we had discussed [here](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8813) before.

# Goals

Correct the behaviors of case 4 and case 5.

- Do not create the partitioned metadata when calling `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`, the partitioned metadata only will be created when consumers/producers are trying to register.
- Instead of returning a `0` partitioned metadata, respond to a not found error when calling `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic` if the topic does not exist.

# Detailed Design

## Public-facing Changes

When you call the public API `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`, pulsar will not create the partitioned metadata anymore.

### Public API
**LookupService.java**
```
// This API existed before. Not change it, thus ensuring compatibility.
CompletableFuture<PartitionedTopicMetadata> getPartitionedTopicMetadata(TopicName topicName);

// A new API that contains an additional param "createIfAutoCreationEnabled".
CompletableFuture<PartitionedTopicMetadata> getPartitionedTopicMetadata(TopicName topicName, boolean createIfAutoCreationEnabled);
```

### Binary protocol

**CommandPartitionedTopicMetadata**
```
message CommandPartitionedTopicMetadata {
    + optional bool create_if_auto_creation_enabled = 6 [default = true];
}
```

# Monitoring

<!-- 
Describe how the changes you make in this proposal should be monitored. 
Don't describe the detailed metrics - they should be at "Public-facing Changes" / "Metrics" section.
Describe how the user will use the metrics to monitor the feature: Which alerts they should set up, which thresholds, ...

# Security Considerations
<!--
A detailed description of the security details that ought to be considered for the PIP. This is most relevant for any new HTTP endpoints, new Pulsar Protocol Commands, and new security features. The goal is to describe details like which role will have permission to perform an action.

An important aspect to consider is also multi-tenancy: Does the feature I'm adding have the permissions / roles set in such a way that prevent one tenant accessing another tenant's data/configuration? For example, the Admin API to read a specific message for a topic only allows a client to read messages for the target topic. However, that was not always the case. CVE-2021-41571 (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/CVE-2021-41571) resulted because the API was incorrectly written and did not properly prevent a client from reading another topic's messages even though authorization was in place. The problem was missing input validation that verified the requested message was actually a message for that topic. The fix to CVE-2021-41571 was input validation. 

If there is uncertainty for this section, please submit the PIP and request for feedback on the mailing list.
