# PIP-344: Correct the behavior of the public API pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic(topicName)

# Background knowledge

### Topic auto-creation.
- The partitioned topic auto-creation is dependent on `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`
    - It triggers partitioned metadata creation by `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`
    - And triggers the topic partition creation by producers' registration and consumers' registration.
- When calling `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic(topicName)`, Pulsar will automatically create the partitioned topic metadata if it does not exist, either using `HttpLookupService` or `BinaryProtoLookupService`.

### Now `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`'s behavior.
| case | broker allow `auto-create` | param allow <br> `create if not exists` | non-partitioned topic | partitioned topic |  current behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `true/false` | `true/false` | `exists: true` | | HTTP API: `partitions: 0`<br> Binary API: `partitions: 0` |
| 2 | `true/false` | `true/false` | | `exists: true` <br> `partitions: 3` | HTTP API: `partitions: 3`<br> Binary API: `partitions: 3` |
| 3 | `true` | `true` | | | HTTP API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: true` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 3` <br> Binary API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: true` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 3` <br> |
| 4 | `true` | `false` | | | HTTP API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: false` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 0` <br> Binary API: not support <br> |
| 5 | `false` | `true` | | | HTTP API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: false` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 0` <br> Binary API: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `create new: false` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- `partitions: 0` <br> |

# Motivation

- For the case 4 of `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`'s behavior, it always tries to create the partitioned metadata, but the API name is `getxxx`.
- For the case 5 of `pulsarClient.getPartitionsForTopic`'s behavior, it returns a `0` partitioned metadata, but the topic not exists. For this behavior, we had discussed [here](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8813) before.

# Goals

- Do not try to create the partitioned metadata when calling 


# High Level Design

<!--
Describe the design of your solution in *high level*.
Describe the solution end to end, from a birds-eye view.
Don't go into implementation details in this section.

I should be able to finish reading from beginning of the PIP to here (including) and understand the feature and 
how you intend to solve it, end to end.

DON'T
* Avoid code snippets, unless it's essential to explain your intent.

# Detailed Design

## Design & Implementation Details

<!--
This is the section where you dive into the details. It can be:
* Concrete class names and their roles and responsibility, including methods.
* Code snippets of existing code.
* Interface names and its methods.
* ...
-->

## Public-facing Changes

<!--
Describe the additions you plan to make for each public facing component. 
Remove the sections you are not changing.
Clearly mark any changes which are BREAKING backward compatability.
-->

### Public API
<!--
When adding a new endpoint to the REST API, please make sure to document the following:

* path
* query parameters
* HTTP body parameters, usually as JSON.
* Response codes, and for each what they mean.
  For each response code, please include a detailed description of the response body JSON, specifying each field and what it means.
  This is the place to document the errors.
-->

### Binary protocol

### Configuration

### CLI

### Metrics

<!--
For each metric provide:
* Full name
* Description
* Attributes (labels)
* Unit
-->


# Monitoring

<!-- 
Describe how the changes you make in this proposal should be monitored. 
Don't describe the detailed metrics - they should be at "Public-facing Changes" / "Metrics" section.
Describe how the user will use the metrics to monitor the feature: Which alerts they should set up, which thresholds, ...
-->

# Security Considerations
<!--
A detailed description of the security details that ought to be considered for the PIP. This is most relevant for any new HTTP endpoints, new Pulsar Protocol Commands, and new security features. The goal is to describe details like which role will have permission to perform an action.

An important aspect to consider is also multi-tenancy: Does the feature I'm adding have the permissions / roles set in such a way that prevent one tenant accessing another tenant's data/configuration? For example, the Admin API to read a specific message for a topic only allows a client to read messages for the target topic. However, that was not always the case. CVE-2021-41571 (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/CVE-2021-41571) resulted because the API was incorrectly written and did not properly prevent a client from reading another topic's messages even though authorization was in place. The problem was missing input validation that verified the requested message was actually a message for that topic. The fix to CVE-2021-41571 was input validation. 

If there is uncertainty for this section, please submit the PIP and request for feedback on the mailing list.
