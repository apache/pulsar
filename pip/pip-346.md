# PIP-346: Add a simplified configuration file for Pulsar

# Background knowledge

Nowadays, `broker.conf` contains almost all the configurations of the broker. It's hard to manage the configurations in a single file, which reach almost **500** configurations. 

However, we will only modify a few configurations in the daily work. It's horrible for a beginner to start to learn pulsar, and it's also a potentially error-prone process for advanced users to maintain such a large configuration file.

We can learn from zookeeper that it uses a simplified configuration file, which only contains the configurations that are frequently modified and hides all the configurations that are rarely modified and advanced.

# Goals

## In Scope

Add a simplified configuration file for Pulsar, which only contains the configurations that are frequently modified.


# Detailed Design

## Design & Implementation Details

- rename current `broker.conf` to `complete_broker.conf`
- add a new `broker.conf` which only contains the configurations that are frequently modified


# Backward & Forward Compatibility

Fully compatible.
