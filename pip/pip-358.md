# PIP-358: let resource weight work for OverloadShedder, LeastLongTermMessageRate, ModularLoadManagerImpl.

# Background knowledge

Initially, we introduce `loadBalancerCPUResourceWeight`, `loadBalancerBandwidthInResourceWeight`, `loadBalancerBandwidthOutResourceWeight`, 
`loadBalancerMemoryResourceWeight`, `loadBalancerDirectMemoryResourceWeight` in `ThresholdShedder` to control the resource weight for 
different resources when calculating the load of the broker. 
Then we let it work for `LeastResourceUsageWithWeight` for better bundle placement policy.

But https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19559 and https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21168 have point out that the actual load of 
the broker is not related to the memory usage and direct memory usage, thus we have changed the default value of
`loadBalancerMemoryResourceWeight`, `loadBalancerDirectMemoryResourceWeight` to 0.0.

There are still some places where memory usage and direct memory usage are used to calculate the load of the broker, such as
`OverloadShedder`, `LeastLongTermMessageRate`, `ModularLoadManagerImpl`. We should let the resource weight work for these places
so that we can set the resource weight to 0.0 to avoid the impact of memory usage and direct memory usage on the load of the broker.

# Motivation

The actual load of the broker is not related to the memory usage and direct memory usage, thus we should let the resource weight work for
`OverloadShedder`, `LeastLongTermMessageRate`, `ModularLoadManagerImpl` so that we can set the resource weight to 0.0 to avoid the impact of
memory usage and direct memory usage on the load of the broker.


# Detailed Design

- Let resource weight work for `OverloadShedder`, `LeastLongTermMessageRate`, `ModularLoadManagerImpl`.
