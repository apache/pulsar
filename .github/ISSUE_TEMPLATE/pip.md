labels: PIP

## Motivation

Explain why this change is needed, what benefits it would bring to Apache Pulsar
and what problem it's trying to solve.

## Goal

Define the scope of this proposal. Given the motivation stated above, what are
the problems that this proposal is addressing and what other items will be
considering out of scope, perhaps to be left to a different PIP.

## API Changes

Illustrate all the proposed changes to the API or wire protocol, with examples
of all the newly added classes/methods, including Javadoc.

## Implementation

This should be a detailed description of all the changes that are
expected to be made. It should be detailed enough that any developer that is
familiar with Pulsar internals would be able to understand all the parts of the
code changes for this proposal.

This should also serve as documentation for any person that is trying to
understand or debug the behavior of a certain feature.


## Reject Alternatives

If there are alternatives that were already considered by the authors or,
after the discussion, by the community, and were rejected, please list them
here along with the reason why they were rejected.
